      "abstract": "\n \n \n \n \n \nMarriage is a beneficial institution when it provides satisfaction to both partners. However, divorce rates have increased in Indonesia in the past five years, with Riau Province ranking eighth in the country with the highest divorce rate. This study aimed to investigate the extent to which adult attachment and religiosity influence the marital satisfaction of civil servants in Riau Province. Adult attachment dimensions were assessed using the Experience in Close Relationship (ECR) Scale Inventory, while religiosity was measured using The Four Basic Dimensions of Religiousness Scale (4-BDRS). Marital satisfaction was evaluated using the Marital Satisfaction Scale (MSS), which was adapted from the Marital Satisfaction Synder Inventory. The sample comprised 350 participants who met the eligibility criteria, selected using offline and online surveys through convenience sampling. The results of the multiple regression analysis revealed that the anxiety and avoidance dimensions of adult attachment, along with religiosity, jointly influenced the marital satisfaction of civil servants in the Riau Province government, accounting for 52.6% of the variance. The analysis also showed that the avoidance dimension of adult attachment had a more significant effect on marital satisfaction than the anxiety and religiosity dimensions. This study provides important information for the government to improve the marital satisfaction of civil servants in different regions of Indonesia. \n \n \n \n \n \n"

      "abstract": "Introduction: There is still no consensus in the literature on how religiosity/ spirituality (R/S) would act as an instrument of social support in individuals with chronic diseases. Objectives: To evaluate the perception of social support and R/S measures in adult patients with epilepsy (PCE). Methods: Data from the Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiosity/Spirituality (BMMRS-P) and the Social Support Satisfaction Scale (ESSS) of 44 PCE were evaluated. BMMRS-P and ESSS data were related to the clinical variables of epilepsy, with statistical tests, with P < 0.05. Results: Gender was female in 28 (63.6%) cases, mean age was 44.3 \u00b1 14.3 years, and mean disease duration was 28.1 \u00b1 16.1 years. The reported religion was Catholic in 25 cases, Evangelical in 13 cases, other in 2 cases and no religion or agnostic in 4 cases. The total score on the BMMRS-P self-assessment was 4.2 \u00b1 1.7, and the total score on the ESSS was 55.5 \u00b1 4.0. Younger PCE have less organizational religiosity (Person correlation; -0.360; P = 0.019). There is a greater perception of forgiveness (0.367; P = 0.024) and religious and spiritual overcoming (0.437; P = 0.006) in PWE with younger age at the time of the first epileptic seizure. The duration of epilepsy was negatively correlated with daily spiritual experience (-0.310; P = 0.040), with religious support (-0.440; P = 0.003) and with organizational religiosity (-0.309; P = 0.041). Schooling correlated with organizational religiosity (0.401; P = 0.009). There was a significant correlation between the perception of social support in the friends dimension and religious support (0.325; P = 0.031) of the BMMRS-P. There was no significant difference in the perception of social support and R/S according to the epilepsy variables and the type of epilepsy syndrome. Conclusion: Social support in epilepsy is important for PWE to deal with the unpredictability of epileptic seizures, with the stigma and social restrictions that these individuals are sometimes subject to. The use of R/S can positively contribute to coping with psychosocial aspects of epilepsy."

      "abstract": "This study explored the relationship among religiosity, life satisfaction, and death anxiety in a sample of Pakistani adults, with a focus on the moderating role of life satisfaction in the link between religiosity and death anxiety. Drawing on theories such as Terror Management Theory and Meaning Management Theory, the study examined how spiritual beliefs and subjective well-being interact to influence existential concerns. Participants (N = 200) completed standardized measures assessing their levels of religiosity, life satisfaction, and death anxiety. Results indicated a significant negative correlation between religiosity and death anxiety, as well as between life satisfaction and death anxiety, while religiosity was positively associated with life satisfaction. Moreover, life satisfaction significantly moderated the relationship between religiosity and death anxiety, suggesting that individuals with both high religiosity and high life satisfaction reported the lowest levels of death anxiety. These findings have important implications for clinical practice and public mental health, particularly in religious and collectivist societies, highlighting the protective role of spirituality and life meaning in managing fear of death."

      "abstract": "Tornstam identified a potential maturation process during aging that leads to a new vision and understanding of life, which he called gerotranscendence and which proved to be linked to the maintenance of well-being levels. Although his contributions have aroused considerable interest, they have also prompted much criticism. In order to empirically explore the proposal, an incidental sample of 370 Argentine adults was administered a battery of instruments that evaluated: age, spiritual transcendence, life satisfaction, centrality of events, and religiosity. The results indicate that age partially explains spiritual transcendence, just as age partially explains life satisfaction. However, the relationship between age and spiritual transcendence is not exclusive to old age. On the other hand, in the exploration of latent variables at chronological age, the centrality of events makes it possible to partially explain both the variance of spiritual transcendence and life satisfaction. While religiosity, in its socio-community contribution, is excluded from the explanatory model of gerotranscendence. Future studies should delve into the possible latent variables at chronological age and the socio-community contributions that could add to the understanding of the link between aging, spiritual transcendence and well-being."

      "abstract": "The associations between morningness-eveningness, conscientiousness, and religiosity have not been investigated to date. The aim of the present research was to provide evidence for the relationships between these dimensions. Moreover, we tested whether the well-established link between morningness and life satisfaction could be explained by elevated religiosity of morning-oriented individuals and whether this relationship may be mediated by conscientiousness. The investigation was conducted on two independent samples of Polish adults (N = 500 and N = 728). Our results corroborated earlier findings that morningness was positively associated with both conscientiousness and satisfaction with life. We also found evidence for a significant positive association between morningness and religiosity. Moreover, controlling for age and gender, we obtained significant mediation effects showing that the association between morningness-eveningness and satisfaction with life might stem, at least in part, from the higher religiosity among morning-oriented individuals, also when conscientiousness was included in the model. It means that more morning-oriented individuals may benefit from higher psychological well-being thanks to both personality characteristics and attitudes towards religion."
