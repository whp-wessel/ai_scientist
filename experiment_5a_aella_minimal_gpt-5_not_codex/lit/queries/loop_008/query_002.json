      "abstract": "Outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases occur even in countries that have unrestricted and relatively equitable accesses to immunizations because vaccine uptake rates are lower than necessary for effective disease control. Vaccine hesitancy is seen in many countries, including Canada, and has led to enacting or strengthening legislation requiring mandatory childhood immunization in some provinces. Although mandatory immunization may seem to be the simplest solution to this issue, it is not always as effective as anticipated. Different countries/states/provinces/territories have used different strategies to encourage parents to fully immunize their children. Definition, scope, flexibility (such as exemptions for medical, religious and philosophical reasons) and framework factors (such as strictness of application and levels of enforcement of the mandate) vary widely between jurisdictions. Surprisingly, no marked differences were seen in vaccination rates between countries that recommended versus mandated them. Unintended consequences of mandatory immunization programs\u2014both good (increased availability of data) and bad (\u201cgaming\u201d of the system and disproportionate impacts on families of lower socioeconomic status) have been reported. Addressing lower vaccine uptake rates is a complex problem that needs a multipronged, more nuanced and tailored approach.

      "abstract": "Research has long established that parents who do not share the same religious tradition produce less religious children than parents who do. Therefore, religious heterogamy and its negative effects on religious socialization have been associated with the generational decline of religion in Western societies. How about China, where religion has been resurging in the last few decades? Existing studies suggest two opposing possibilities: the restrictive national context may diminish parental impact on religious socialization, or the family influence withstands contextual pressures. Using the 2007 Spiritual Life Survey of Chinese Residents and logistic regression models, we examine patterns of association between having one or two religious parents during childhood and current religious affiliation, beliefs, behavior, and salience of respondents in China. Analyses reveal that despite China\u2019s atheist education system and strict religion policies, having at least one religiously affiliated parent is associated with increased religiosity compared to having two nonreligious parents. As the number of interreligious marriages rises in Chinese society, religious heterogamy contributes to the growth of religion among younger generations. Whereas religious heterogamy in the West has a secularizing effect on the next generation and contributes to religion\u2019s decline, religious heterogamy in secular nations such as China has a religionizing effect and contributes to religion\u2019s rise."

Penelitian ini memberikan kontribusi penting dengan mengidentifikasi dan mensintesis bukti yang ada mengenai pengaruh pendidikan nilai moral dan agama terhadap perkembangan kognitif, serta menyarankan pentingnya pendekatan holistik dalam pendidikan Islam anak usia dini. \nCorrelation between learning moral and religious values and cognitive development in early childhood Islamic education. The aim is to understand how the integration of moral and religious values in education can affect the cognitive aspects of early childhood. Using a systematic review method, this study analyzed data from various published studies, which were selected based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results show a positive relationship between teaching moral and religious values and improving cognitive abilities such as problem-solving, creativity and critical thinking in early childhood. This study makes an important contribution by identifying and synthesizing existing evidence on the effect of moral and religious values education on cognitive development and suggests the importance of a holistic approach in early childhood Islamic education."
