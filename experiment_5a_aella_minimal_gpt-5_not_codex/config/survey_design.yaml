# TODO: Survey design placeholder
# No survey design metadata (weights/strata/clusters) found.
# Defaulting to SRS (simple random sample) assumptions for exploratory work.
# If design features are later provided, set design_used=true in results and update this file.

design:
  weights: null
  strata: null
  clusters: null
assumption_note: |
  No weights/strata/clusters were detected in repo (see runner _detect_survey_design_features).
  Until provided, we justify SRS as a working assumption and will include sensitivity checks.
