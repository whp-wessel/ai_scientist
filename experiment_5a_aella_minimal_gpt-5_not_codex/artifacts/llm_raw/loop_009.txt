Loop 009 complete. I expanded literature coverage and synchronized artifacts.

- New S2 query saved: `lit/queries/loop_009/query_001.json`
- DOIs appended (+5) to `lit/evidence_map.csv`
- Decision log updated: `analysis/decision_log.csv`
- Notebook updated: `notebooks/research_notebook.md` (Loop 009 entry)
- State updated: `artifacts/state.json` (loop_counter=9; phase=literature)
- Commit message written: `artifacts/git_message.txt`

Notes
- No confirmatory results added; FDR not applicable. Survey design unchanged (SRS justification stands).
- Public outputs unchanged; existing tables already suppress n<10.

Next options
- Broaden literature once `.env` includes `S2_API_Key`.
- Begin ordered/ordinal models for Likert outcomes (exploratory) and outline PAP-freeze criteria.
