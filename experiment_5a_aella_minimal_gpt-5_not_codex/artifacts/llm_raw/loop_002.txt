I profiled the dataset, aligned hypothesis columns to actual names, added safe public tables, and updated literature/logs. Phase remains literature.

**What I Did**
- EDA tooling and outputs
  - Added `scripts/analysis/eda.py:1` (profiles key vars, creates safe public counts with n<10 suppression).
  - Ran: `python scripts/analysis/eda.py --input childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv --summary outputs/eda_summary.json --public-counts tables/key_vars_value_counts.csv`
  - Wrote `outputs/eda_summary.json:1` and `tables/key_vars_value_counts.csv:1` (suppressed counts shown as "<10").
- Hypotheses and PAP alignment
  - Updated outcome variable names to actual dataset columns that are label strings:
    - `analysis/hypotheses.csv:1` now uses e.g., `I am not happy (ix5iyv3)-neg`, `I am satisfied with my romantic relationships (hp9qz6f)`, etc.
  - Clarified estimands/columns and EDA command in `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`.
- Codebook expansion
  - Added key variable entries and coding assumptions in `data/codebook.yaml:1`.
- Notebook and paper
  - Logged loop work and next steps in `notebooks/research_notebook.md:33`.
  - Referenced new public table in `reports/paper.md:22`.
- Decision log and state
  - Appended EDA run, alignment, and literature deferral to `analysis/decision_log.csv:1`.
  - Updated `artifacts/state.json:1` (loop_counter=2, last_updated).
  - Wrote commit request to `artifacts/git_message.txt:1`.

**Privacy**
- All public counts in `tables/key_vars_value_counts.csv:1` mask n<10 cells per policy.

**Literature**
- Semantic Scholar query still deferred due to missing `.env` `S2_API_Key`. Helper exists (`scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py:1`). Once key is added, I’ll run and extract DOIs to `lit/evidence_map.csv`.

**Next Steps**
- Add `.env` with `S2_API_Key` and run the saved search; update `lit/evidence_map.csv`.
- Draft minimal modeling script and begin exploratory estimates for H1–H4; write rows to `analysis/results.csv` with SRS justification.
