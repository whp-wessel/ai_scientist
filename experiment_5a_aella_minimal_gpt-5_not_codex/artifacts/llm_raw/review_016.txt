DECISION: CONTINUE

R1 Reproducibility: PASS — Seeds and commands recorded in analysis/decision_log.csv; default seed noted in notebooks/research_notebook.md and PAP; scripts exist (scripts/analysis/*.py; scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py); queries saved under lit/queries/loop_016/query_001.json.

R2 Statistical Rigor: PASS — No survey design provided; SRS justified (config/survey_design.yaml:1). Results include estimate, SE, CI, p (analysis/results.csv:2). All rows marked confirmatory=false; no FDR/q-values required yet.

R3 Literature/Evidence: PASS — Evidence map maintained (lit/evidence_map.csv); Semantic Scholar JSON saved (lit/queries/loop_016/query_001.json); manuscript cites a DOI (reports/paper.md:9) and bibliography exists (lit/bibliography.bib).

R4 Privacy: PASS — Public tables apply n<10 masking (tables/key_vars_value_counts.csv:8 shows “<10”); cross-tab table has all cells ≥10 (tables/religion_by_monogamy.csv).

R5 Completeness: PASS — PAP present and clearly “status: draft” (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1); results registry populated (analysis/results.csv); manuscript present (reports/paper.md); required artifacts exist.

Notes: Recommend adding artifacts/git_message.txt for a checkpoint in the next loop to keep reproducibility aligned.
