Literature loop logged; now adding one more S2 query and updating artifacts.

- Ran Semantic Scholar search (unauthenticated; 1 rps enforced). Saved JSON with 429 to `lit/queries/loop_014/query_001.json`. Extracted 0 DOIs into `lit/evidence_map.csv` this loop.
- Updated logs and narrative:
  - Appended Loop 014 actions to `analysis/decision_log.csv`.
  - Added Loop 014 section to `notebooks/research_notebook.md`.
  - Noted new query artifact in `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md` under literature.
- Bumped loop state to 14 and timestamp in `artifacts/state.json`.
- Wrote commit request to `artifacts/git_message.txt`.

Files touched:
- lit/queries/loop_014/query_001.json
- analysis/decision_log.csv
- notebooks/research_notebook.md
- analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md
- artifacts/state.json
- artifacts/git_message.txt

Notes
- Phase remains literature. No confirmatory results added; `analysis/results.csv` unchanged.
- Privacy: no new public tables; existing ones continue n<10 suppression.
- To advance literature efficiently, add `S2_API_Key` to `.env` and I’ll re-run queries and populate `lit/evidence_map.csv` with abstracts/DOIs.

Next step options
- Provide `.env` with `S2_API_Key` to re-run `lit/queries/loop_014/query_001.json` and expand evidence.
- If staying unauthenticated, I can pivot to refining estimands/covariates in the PAP toward freeze for Wellbeing and Relationships.
