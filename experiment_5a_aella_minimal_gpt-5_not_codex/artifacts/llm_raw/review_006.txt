DECISION: CONTINUE

R1 Reproducibility: WARN — Seeds, commands, and logs are present (`artifacts/seed.txt:1`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:1`, scripts under `scripts/analysis/`). However, `artifacts/git_message.txt` is missing despite being claimed; add a one‑line commit message to align with the commit protocol.

R2 Statistical Rigor: PASS — SRS is explicitly justified (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`; `analysis/results.csv:1` has `design_used=false` and `srs_justification`). Effect sizes, SEs, CIs, and p‑values are recorded (`analysis/results.csv:1`). No confirmatory families yet; q‑values not required.

R3 Literature/Evidence: PASS — At least one citable source with DOI is recorded and cited (`lit/bibliography.bib:1`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:1`, `reports/paper.md:1`). Semantic Scholar queries are executed via the helper and saved, albeit rate‑limited pending API key (`lit/queries/...`).

R4 Privacy: PASS — Public tables mask n<10 cells (e.g., `tables/key_vars_value_counts.csv:1`; `tables/religion_by_monogamy.csv:1` shows no small cells).

R5 Completeness: PASS — Required artifacts exist and are coherent for the literature phase: PAP (draft) (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`), hypotheses (`analysis/hypotheses.csv:1`), results (`analysis/results.csv:1`), notebook (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:1`), paper (`reports/paper.md:1`), state (`artifacts/state.json:1`).

Notes: Please add `artifacts/git_message.txt` to request a checkpoint. Provide `.env` `S2_API_Key` to run Semantic Scholar queries and expand `lit/evidence_map.csv`.
