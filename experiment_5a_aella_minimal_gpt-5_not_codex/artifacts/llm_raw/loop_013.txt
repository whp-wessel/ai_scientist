Loop 013: expanded literature, updated logs, prepped next PAP steps.

- Literature search
  - Saved query (429 captured): lit/queries/loop_013/query_001.json
  - Saved query (success): lit/queries/loop_013/query_002.json
  - DOIs appended (3): lit/evidence_map.csv (E32–E34)

- Artifacts updated
  - Decision log: analysis/decision_log.csv (added Loop 013 entries)
  - Notebook: notebooks/research_notebook.md (Loop 013 narrative and next steps)
  - PAP (literature refs): analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md (added loop_013 reference)
  - State: artifacts/state.json (loop_counter=13, last_updated=2025-11-08T15:05:08Z)
  - Commit request: artifacts/git_message.txt

- Survey design
  - No weights/strata/clusters found; continue with SRS justification (config/survey_design.yaml; echoed in results).

- Privacy
  - No new public tables; existing tables respect n<10 masking (tables/*).

- Next steps
  - Provide `.env` S2_API_Key to stabilize API calls and fetch abstracts.
  - Draft PAP refinements for Wellbeing and Relationships families; plan PAP freeze before any confirmatory testing.
  - Consider ordinal models for Likert items as a sensitivity check.

If you’d like, I can proceed to: broaden literature (homogamy/assortative mating and relationship quality), refine PAP estimands/covariates toward freeze, or run exploratory ordinal models.
