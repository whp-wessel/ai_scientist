**Summary**

- Advanced literature phase, expanded evidence, and fixed the checkpoint gap flagged by review.

**What I Did**
- Ran S2 helper queries and saved payloads:
  - `lit/queries/loop_008/query_001.json:1` (search; 429 unauthenticated, recorded)
  - `lit/queries/loop_008/paper_ace.json:1` (paper by DOI; metadata saved)
  - `lit/queries/loop_008/query_002.json:1` (search; success)
- Extracted DOIs from successful search and appended to evidence map:
  - `lit/evidence_map.csv:7` (added E7–E11 via `scripts/lit/extract_dois.py`)
- Added sensitivity stub outlining ordinal models and robustness:
  - `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:1`
- Updated the research log and notebook:
  - `analysis/decision_log.csv:1` (appended Loop 008 actions)
  - `notebooks/research_notebook.md:1` (added Loop 008 section)
- Bumped state and added a commit request:
  - `artifacts/state.json:1` (loop_counter=8; phase=literature)
  - `artifacts/git_message.txt:1` (one-line message)

**Decisions**
- Stay in literature phase; no confirmatory tests added.
- All recorded results remain `confirmatory=false`; no q-values applicable.
- Survey design still unknown; analyses continue with explicit SRS justification (see `config/survey_design.yaml:1` and per-row `analysis/results.csv:1`).

**Privacy**
- No new public tables created; existing `tables/*` already apply n<10 suppression.

**Next Steps**
- Provide `.env` with `S2_API_Key` to avoid 429s and broaden searches; I can then enrich `lit/evidence_map.csv` and update `reports/paper.md`.
- Begin ordered logit/probit refits for H1–H4 and simple nonlinearity checks (drafted in `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:1`).
