Updated literature, logs, and state; added one S2 query.

**What I Did**
- Ran one Semantic Scholar query (1 rps) and saved JSON:
  - `lit/queries/loop_016/query_001.json`
- Extracted DOIs into the evidence map:
  - `lit/evidence_map.csv`
- Logged actions and narrative:
  - `analysis/decision_log.csv`
  - `notebooks/research_notebook.md`
- Bumped loop counter and timestamp; added commit message:
  - `artifacts/state.json`
  - `artifacts/git_message.txt`

**Key Artifacts**
- Query JSON: `lit/queries/loop_016/query_001.json`
- Evidence map (5 DOIs appended): `lit/evidence_map.csv`
- Decision log (rows appended): `analysis/decision_log.csv`
- Notebook (new section): `notebooks/research_notebook.md`
- State snapshot: `artifacts/state.json`
- Commit message: `artifacts/git_message.txt`

**Notes**
- Still in literature phase; no confirmatory results.
- Survey design: no weights/strata/clusters found; SRS justified (see `config/survey_design.yaml`).
- Public outputs: no new tables; existing `tables/*` obey n<10 masking.

**Next**
- Add `.env` with `S2_API_Key` to stabilize S2 queries and expand literature per family.
- Tighten PAP estimands for Relationships (H2) and define freeze criteria; consider ordinal models for Likert items.
