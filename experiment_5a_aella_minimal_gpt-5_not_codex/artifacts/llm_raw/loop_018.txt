I reviewed the repo and review notes; advancing literature for H2 next.

**Loop Summary**
- Ran a targeted Semantic Scholar search for H2 (relationships/meta-analysis) via the CLI; saved the 429 response for audit.
- Attempted DOI extraction; none appended (expected due to 429).
- Updated the notebook narrative, decision log, and state; left results non‑confirmatory.

**Artifacts Updated**
- Query JSON: lit/queries/loop_018/query_001.json:1
- Decision log (4 new rows): analysis/decision_log.csv:2
- Notebook (new section): notebooks/research_notebook.md:271
- State (counter + timestamp): artifacts/state.json:9
- Commit request: artifacts/git_message.txt:1

**What I Ran**
- `python scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py search --query "religiosity relationship satisfaction meta-analysis" --limit 5 --output lit/queries/loop_018/query_001.json`
- `python scripts/lit/extract_dois.py --input lit/queries/loop_018/query_001.json --output lit/evidence_map.csv --topic "religiosity and relationship satisfaction"`

**Notes**
- No public tables added; small-cell rule remains satisfied.
- Still in literature phase; no confirmatory results, so no q-values required.
- SRS assumption unchanged (no survey design features present).

**Next Actions**
- Provide `.env` with `S2_API_Key` so I can rerun authenticated searches and expand `lit/evidence_map.csv`.
- If a key isn’t available, I can schedule staggered queries and proceed to tighten the PAP for H2 (ordinal model choices, covariates, freeze criteria, FDR plan).
