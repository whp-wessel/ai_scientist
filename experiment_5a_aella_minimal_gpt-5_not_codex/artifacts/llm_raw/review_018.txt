DECISION: CONTINUE

R1 Reproducibility: WARN — Seeds recorded (`artifacts/seed.txt`), environment logged (`artifacts/session_info.txt`), and commands captured (`analysis/decision_log.csv`). However, no commit request file is present (`artifacts/git_message.txt` missing) despite the claim in `artifacts/last_model_raw.txt`.

R2 Statistical Rigor: PASS — All tests are exploratory (confirmatory=false). SRS is explicitly justified (`design_used=false`, `srs_justification` in `analysis/results.csv`). Effect sizes, SEs, CIs, and p‑values are provided.

R3 Literature/Evidence: PASS — Saved query JSONs under `lit/queries/`; DOIs curated in `lit/evidence_map.csv`; manuscript cites DOI in `reports/paper.md`. Some searches returned HTTP 429 unauthenticated, but evidence tracking exists.

R4 Privacy: PASS — Public outputs in `tables/` apply n<10 suppression (e.g., `tables/key_vars_value_counts.csv` shows “<10”). `tables/religion_by_monogamy.csv` contains no cells <10.

R5 Completeness: PASS — PAP is `status: draft` (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`); manuscript present (`reports/paper.md`); registries present (`analysis/hypotheses.csv`, `analysis/results.csv`). No confirmatory results, so no freeze/tag required yet.

Notes: Add `artifacts/git_message.txt` for this loop’s checkpoint. Provide `S2_API_Key` to avoid 429s and expand `lit/evidence_map.csv`.
