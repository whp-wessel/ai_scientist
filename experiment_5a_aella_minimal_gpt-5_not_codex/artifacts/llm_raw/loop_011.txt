I’m advancing the literature phase for Loop 011: I’ll run a focused Semantic Scholar query with our CLI, extract DOIs into the evidence map, update the notebook and logs, and bump the loop state.

What I changed
- Added a new Semantic Scholar query JSON: lit/queries/loop_011/query_001.json
- Appended 5 DOIs to evidence map (E22–E26): lit/evidence_map.csv
- Logged actions: analysis/decision_log.csv
- Updated notebook with Loop 011 narrative: notebooks/research_notebook.md
- Bumped state snapshot (loop=11): artifacts/state.json
- Wrote commit message to checkpoint: artifacts/git_message.txt

Key actions and commands
- Query (1 req/sec enforced; unauthenticated): python scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py search --query "childhood religiosity adult wellbeing depression anxiety monogamy" --limit 5 --output lit/queries/loop_011/query_001.json
- Extract DOIs: python scripts/lit/extract_dois.py --input lit/queries/loop_011/query_001.json --output lit/evidence_map.csv --topic "childhood religiosity and adult outcomes"

File highlights
- analysis/decision_log.csv: appended rows for the search, DOI extraction, notebook update, and state bump.
- notebooks/research_notebook.md: added “Loop 011 (literature)” with summary, notes, and next steps.
- artifacts/state.json: set last_updated to 2025-11-08T14:54:30Z and loop_counter to 11.
- artifacts/git_message.txt: loop011: expand literature via S2 CLI; append 5 DOIs; update notebook, decision log, and state (phase=literature)
- lit/evidence_map.csv: added E22–E26, including BMC Psychiatry 2023 (DOI: 10.1186/s12888-023-05091-2) and an antecedent on adolescent religiosity and adult wellbeing (DOI: 10.1108/02683940310484044).

Privacy and reproducibility
- No new public tables created; existing ones obey n<10 suppression (verified counts).
- All actions and commands recorded; seed unchanged.

Next steps
- Provide `.env` with S2_API_Key to broaden literature searches and pull more abstracts/metadata.
- Draft a literature synthesis in reports/paper.md and expand lit/bibliography.bib from evidence_map DOIs.
- If desired, begin preparing PAP freeze criteria (estimands/covariates) before confirmatory testing.

If you want, I can proceed to enrich bibliography entries, summarize top papers for the manuscript, or scaffold ordered models for Likert outcomes.
