I ran the next literature loop, added a new S2 search, and updated logs/state.

**Loop 017 Summary**
- Ran Semantic Scholar search (unauthenticated); received 429 and saved payload.
- Attempted DOI extraction (0 appended, as expected).
- Updated notebook narrative, decision log, and state; added commit message.

**Files Updated**
- Query JSON: `lit/queries/loop_017/query_001.json`
- Evidence map: `lit/evidence_map.csv`
- Notebook: `notebooks/research_notebook.md`
- Decision log: `analysis/decision_log.csv`
- State: `artifacts/state.json`
- Commit message: `artifacts/git_message.txt`

**Repro & Policy**
- Commands recorded in `analysis/decision_log.csv`; phase remains literature.
- No new public tables; small-cell rule unchanged and honored.

**Next Steps**
- Add `.env` with `S2_API_Key=<your_key>` to avoid 429s, then rerun `lit/queries/loop_017/query_001.json` and re-extract DOIs.
- Continue pruning/tightening `lit/evidence_map.csv` around longitudinal adult outcomes (H1–H3).
- When literature feels sufficient, advance to PAP freeze criteria.

Would you like me to proceed to rerun the query after you add the API key, or begin drafting freeze criteria for the PAP?
