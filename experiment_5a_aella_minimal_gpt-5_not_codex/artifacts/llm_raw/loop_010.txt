I reviewed the repo and latest review notes; expanding literature for H2 and checkpointing this loop.

**What I Did**
- Ran targeted S2 search (H2): saved `lit/queries/loop_010/query_001.json:1`
- Appended 5 DOIs to evidence map (E17–E21): `lit/evidence_map.csv:1`
- Logged actions: appended two rows to `analysis/decision_log.csv:1`
- Notebook update: added Loop 010 summary to `notebooks/research_notebook.md:1`
- State bump: updated `artifacts/state.json:1` (loop_counter=10; refreshed timestamp)
- Commit request: wrote `artifacts/git_message.txt:1`

**Reproducibility**
- Command trace recorded in `analysis/decision_log.csv:1` and `notebooks/research_notebook.md:1`
- S2 helper enforces 1 req/sec; unauthenticated warning preserved
- No randomness used this loop; seed remains in `artifacts/seed.txt:1`

**Statistical/Privacy**
- No new analyses; all existing results remain exploratory (confirmatory=false)
- SRS justification unchanged (no design metadata)
- No new public tables; existing tables enforce n<10 suppression

**Next Steps**
- Add `.env` `S2_API_Key` to broaden literature and fetch abstracts
- Refine PAP estimands/covariates; prepare freeze/tag criteria before any confirmatory testing
- Optionally begin exploratory ordered models for Likert outcomes

If you want, I can proceed to run additional focused S2 queries (with key) and start pruning/annotating the evidence map for direct manuscript citations.
