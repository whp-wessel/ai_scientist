Loop 007 complete. I expanded literature, synced artifacts, and fixed the reviewer’s commit-message gap.

**What I Did**
- Ran Semantic Scholar search via helper; saved JSON: lit/queries/loop_007/query_001.json
- Added DOI extractor: scripts/lit/extract_dois.py
- Extracted DOIs to evidence map (E2–E6 appended): lit/evidence_map.csv
- Logged actions: analysis/decision_log.csv
- Updated notebook with Loop 007 notes: notebooks/research_notebook.md
- Bumped loop/state and added commit message: artifacts/state.json, artifacts/git_message.txt

**Key Details**
- Phase remains literature; no confirmatory analyses added.
- Privacy: No new public tables; small-cell policy already enforced in tables/.
- SRS justification unchanged (no design features yet).

**Files Updated**
- lit/queries/loop_007/query_001.json:1
- scripts/lit/extract_dois.py:1
- lit/evidence_map.csv:1
- analysis/decision_log.csv:1
- notebooks/research_notebook.md:1
- artifacts/state.json:1
- artifacts/git_message.txt:1

**Next Steps**
- Provide `.env` `S2_API_Key` to broaden/accelerate literature; then expand lit/evidence_map.csv and cite in reports/paper.md.
- Begin sensitivity outline (ordinal models, nonlinear terms, added covariates) and prep for PAP freeze.
