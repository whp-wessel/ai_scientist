I’ll advance the literature phase this loop: run a targeted S2 query, update evidence, refresh the PAP’s literature section, log actions, and request a commit.

**What I Did**
- Ran Semantic Scholar search (5 results) and saved JSON.
- Extracted DOIs and appended to the evidence map.
- Updated PAP literature section to reference loop_011 and loop_012 queries.
- Logged all actions and updated the notebook narrative.
- Bumped loop counter and wrote a commit message.

**Artifacts Updated**
- `lit/queries/loop_012/query_001.json`: new search JSON (religiosity, depression/anxiety, monogamy, satisfaction).
- `lit/evidence_map.csv`: appended 5 DOIs with topic “religiosity, monogamy, wellbeing”.
- `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:42`: literature section references `lit/queries/loop_011/query_001.json` and `lit/queries/loop_012/query_001.json`.
- `notebooks/research_notebook.md:120`: added “Loop 012 (literature)” entry.
- `analysis/decision_log.csv`: appended loop_012 entries (query, DOI extraction, PAP and notebook updates).
- `artifacts/state.json`: loop_counter=12; last_updated set to current UTC.
- `artifacts/git_message.txt`: loop_012 one-line commit message.

**Commands Executed**
- `python3 scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py search --query "religiosity depression anxiety monogamy relationship satisfaction adults longitudinal" --limit 5 --output lit/queries/loop_012/query_001.json`
- `python3 scripts/lit/extract_dois.py --input lit/queries/loop_012/query_001.json --output lit/evidence_map.csv --topic "religiosity, monogamy, wellbeing"`

**Privacy & Rigor**
- Public tables remain compliant (n<10 suppressed), e.g., `tables/key_vars_value_counts.csv`, `tables/religion_by_monogamy.csv`.
- Survey design remains SRS with justification; no confirmatory results added; FDR not applicable.

**Next**
- Refine PAP estimands/covariates and propose freeze criteria for two primary families (Wellbeing; Relationships).
- Optionally add ordinal models for Likert outcomes before freeze.
