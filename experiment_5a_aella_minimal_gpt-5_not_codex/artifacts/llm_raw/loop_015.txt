Completed Loop 015. I deepened literature coverage and updated all reproducibility artifacts.

What I did
- Ran targeted S2 search and saved payload
  - Command: python scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py search --query "adolescent religiosity adult relationship satisfaction monogamy longitudinal" --limit 5 --output lit/queries/loop_015/query_001.json
- Extracted DOIs and appended to evidence map
  - Command: python scripts/lit/extract_dois.py --input lit/queries/loop_015/query_001.json --output lit/evidence_map.csv --topic "adolescent religiosity to adult relationship satisfaction (longitudinal)"
  - Added: E35–E38
- Logged actions and advanced the loop/state
  - Updated analysis/decision_log.csv:2
  - Updated notebooks/research_notebook.md with “Loop 015”
  - Updated analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md literature section
  - Updated artifacts/state.json to loop_counter=15; phase=literature
  - Wrote commit request: artifacts/git_message.txt:1

Files changed
- analysis/decision_log.csv:2
- notebooks/research_notebook.md: new “Loop 015 (literature)” section
- analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md: added loop_015 query reference
- lit/evidence_map.csv: appended 4 DOIs (E35–E38)
- artifacts/state.json: updated counter/timestamp
- artifacts/git_message.txt:1

Notes on invariants
- Reproducibility: Commands, paths, and seed maintained (seed 20251016). State updated.
- Privacy: No new public microdata beyond counts; tables remain n<10 suppressed.
- Survey design: SRS assumption remains explicit (no weights/strata/clusters found); no confirmatory results added, so no q-values needed.

Next steps
- Add one focused query on “religious homogamy/assortative mating AND relationship satisfaction.”
- Tighten PAP estimands for Relationships (H2): specify ordinal modeling choice and covariates; prepare to freeze two primary families for confirmatory testing (FDR q ≤ 0.05 if >1 test).
