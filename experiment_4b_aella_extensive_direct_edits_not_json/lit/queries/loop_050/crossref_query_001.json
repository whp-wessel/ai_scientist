Participants were 65.9% (n= 211) female, 34.1% (n= 109) male. The ages of the participants ranged between 20 and 39. The mean of ages was 24.62\u00b13.93. Participants completed Brief Symptom Inventory, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and Adult Resilience Measure.\nResults: Results of analysis indicated that childhood psychological maltreatment directly predicted resilience, negative self-concept and depression in adulthood. Results also showed that childhood psychological maltreatment indirectly predicted negative self-concept and depression by mediated resilience.\nConclusions: Results of the study showed that resilience has a partial mediating role in the relationship between psychological maltreatment-negative self-concept and psychological maltreatment-depression. Therefore, study results are very important on understanding the protective role of resilience in the relationship among these variables.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.5455\/nys.20160328090400","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,3]],"date-time":"2016-04-03T14:42:21Z","timestamp":1459694541000},"page":"3-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Relationship between Childhood Psychological Maltreatment, Resilience, Depression, and Negative Self-concept"],"prefix":"10.5152","volume":"53","author":[{"given":"G\u00f6kmen","family":"Arslan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"3111","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,1]]},"container-title":["Neuropsychiatric Investigation"],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/neuropsychiatricinvestigation.org\/index.php\/pub\/article\/download\/788\/788","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,7,31]],"date-time":"2025-07-31T12:02:44Z","timestamp":1753963364000},"score":22.82824,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/neuropsychiatricinvestigation.org\/index.php\/pub\/article\/view\/788"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"4","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,18]]}},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5455\/nys.20160328090400","ISSN":["2792-0070"],"issn-type":[{"type":"electronic","value":"2792-0070"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,1]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2024,8,16]],"date-time":"2024-08-16T01:40:16Z","timestamp":1723772416690},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Sciscan Publishing Limited","issue":"7","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2024]]},"DOI":"10.35534\/pc.0607143","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,8,16]],"date-time":"2024-08-16T01:10:47Z","timestamp":1723770647000},"page":"1280-1287","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Effect of Adverse Childhood Experiences on Depression: A Mediation of Resilience"],"prefix":"10.35534","volume":"6","author":[{"given":"Gou","family":"Yushi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"21051","container-title":["Psychology of China"],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,8,16]],"date-time":"2024-08-16T01:11:08Z","timestamp":1723770668000},"score":22.315601,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.sciscanpub.com\/index\/journals\/ainfo\/pc\/6411.html"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2024]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"7","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2024]]}},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.35534\/pc.0607143","ISSN":["2664-1798"],"issn-type":[{"value":"2664-1798","type":"print"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2024]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2023,12,1]],"date-time":"2023-12-01T00:30:18Z","timestamp":1701390618523},"publisher":"Austrian Science Fund (FWF)","award-start":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,1]]},"award":"DOC111","DOI":"10.55776\/doc111","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,30]],"date-time":"2023-11-30T15:40:28Z","timestamp":1701358828000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.55776","member":"34446","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"MENTOR - Molecular Mechanisms to Improve Plant Resilience"}],"funding":[{"type":"grant","award-amount":{"amount":1809266.5,"currency":"EUR","percentage":100},"funder":{"id":[{"id":"10.13039\/501100002428","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Austrian Science Fund (FWF)"}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,30]],"date-time":"2023-11-30T15:43:08Z","timestamp":1701358988000},"score":22.035213,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.fwf.ac.at\/en\/research-radar\/10.55776\/DOC111"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,1]]},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.55776\/doc111"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,10,7]],"date-time":"2025-10-07T16:40:16Z","timestamp":1759855216399,"version":"build-2065373602"},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Cambridge University Press (CUP)","content-domain":{"domain":[]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,1]]},"DOI":"10.1017\/gmh.2025.10041.pr8","type":"peer-review","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,8,12]],"date-time":"2025-08-12T05:22:40Z","timestamp":1754976160000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Review: The moderating and mediating role of resilience in the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and depression, PTSD, and suicidality in Kenyan youth \u2014 R1\/PR8"],"prefix":"10.1017","member":"56","review":{"competing-interest-statement":"Thank you for addressing the comments from previous review. However, there are still a few minor issues. \n\nThe abstract uses \"emotional\/physical neglect\". The results section refers to \"higher levels of negligence\". Table 3 and 4 uses \"Emotional negligence\" and \"Physical negligence\". The TADS instrument itself lists \"emotional neglect, and physical neglect\" as domains.\nFor consistency and alignment with standard terminology, would the authors consider using \"emotional neglect\" and \"physical neglect\" uniformly throughout the manuscript, including in tables?\n\nThe abstract mentions p-values for moderation: \"physical abuse on lifetime behavior (p = 0.0479), and total ACEs on recent behavior (p = 0.0514).\" While p=0.0479 is significant, p=0.0514 is strictly non-significant by the p<0.05 criterion (though borderline).\nWould the authors consider rephrasing the p=0.0514 finding in the abstract, perhaps as \"borderline significance\" or by focusing on clearly significant effects to maintain conciseness and precision, or explicitly state their alpha if it differs?\n\n\"Resilience impact on suicidality differs according to the kind of ACE...\" This is a key finding. The abstract says resilience had \"minimal effect on suicidality but moderated specific associations...\"\nIs the \"minimal effect on suicidality\" referring to the overall ACE score\u2019s impact, while the \"differs according to kind of ACE\" refers to the specific domains where moderation was found (e.g. emotional\/physical neglect on ideation)?
