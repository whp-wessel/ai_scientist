The results of the study of the knowledge of African indigenous peoples about the development of young children by discussing the cultural spaces of care, play and education of young children among the Gujji people in Ethiopia (Jirata Tadesse Jaleta) are presented; the understanding of global political interdependence as a response to the triple connection of children's desired future: their struggle for self-development, overcoming normative exclusions and sensitivity of others (J. Wall); research arguments that the modern experience of children and youth requires a rethinking of global justice around the new concept of enhanced inclusion (J. Josefsson, J. Wallu). V. Coppock's conclusion about the instability of diagnostic classification systems reflecting the prevailing ideological, sociocultural and political conditions is presented; approaches of A. McPherson, D. Forster and R. Buchanan, designed to form social skills and conditions for children and youth to master the mental culture of relationships. The phenomena of young people giving new meaning to psychiatric labels, which young people devalue and turn into cultural categories rather than diagnostic categories, given in the work of A. McPherson, D. Forster and R. Buchanan, as well as young children's reflections on their transnational childhood and experience, are highlighted. migrations studied by N. N. David and A. Kilderry. The article presents questions that require a prospective solution in the globalized world of the development of the mental culture of modern and future childhood.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.23880\/mhrij-16000239","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,2,20]],"date-time":"2024-02-20T05:14:17Z","timestamp":1708406057000},"page":"1-4","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Global Content of Mental Culture of Childhood"],"prefix":"10.23880","volume":"8","author":[{"given":"Sergii Ivanovich","family":"Boltivets","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"9969","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024]]},"container-title":["Mental Health &amp; Human Resilience International Journal"],"original-title":["Global Content of Mental Culture of Childhood"],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/medwinpublishers.com\/MHRIJ\/global-content-of-mental-culture-of-childhood.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,5,1]],"date-time":"2025-05-01T15:30:29Z","timestamp":1746113429000},"score":28.779497,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/medwinpublishers.com\/MHRIJ\/global-content-of-mental-culture-of-childhood.pdf"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2024]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024]]}},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.23880\/mhrij-16000239","ISSN":["2578-5095"],"issn-type":[{"type":"electronic","value":"2578-5095"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2024]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,8,26]],"date-time":"2025-08-26T02:10:19Z","timestamp":1756174219461,"version":"3.44.0"},"posted":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,29]]},"group-title":"Article","reference-count":0,"publisher":"The Conversation","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"DOI":"10.64628\/ab.crgweth7y","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,8,26]],"date-time":"2025-08-26T01:34:46Z","timestamp":1756172086000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Key to lifelong good mental health \u2013 learn resilience in childhood"],"prefix":"10.64628","author":[{"given":"Karen","family":"Newbigging","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Birmingham"}]}],"member":"54080","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,8,26]],"date-time":"2025-08-26T01:35:10Z","timestamp":1756172110000},"score":28.770525,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/key-to-lifelong-good-mental-health-learn-resilience-in-childhood-99776"}},"editor":[{"given":"Clint","family":"Witchalls","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,29]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.64628\/ab.crgweth7y","published":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,29]]},"subtype":"other"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,5,2]],"date-time":"2025-05-02T04:09:42Z","timestamp":1746158982455,"version":"3.40.4"},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Medwin Publishers","issue":"2","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["MHRIJ"],"DOI":"10.23880\/mhrij-16000156","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,4]],"date-time":"2022-03-04T11:08:38Z","timestamp":1646392118000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Psychic Decline, Diogenes Syndrome and Parental Capacity"],"prefix":"10.23880","volume":"5","author":[{"given":"Tiffon","family":"BN","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"9969","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"container-title":["Mental Health &amp; Human Resilience International Journal"],"original-title":["Psychic Decline, Diogenes Syndrome and Parental Capacity"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,4]],"date-time":"2022-03-04T11:08:52Z","timestamp":1646392132000},"score":28.670197,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/medwinpublishers.com\/MHRIJ\/psychic-decline-diogenes-syndrome-and-parental-capacity.pdf"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021]]}},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.23880\/mhrij-16000156","ISSN":["2578-5095"],"issn-type":[{"type":"electronic","value":"2578-5095"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2021]]}}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":"childhood parental guidance resilience mental health"}}}
