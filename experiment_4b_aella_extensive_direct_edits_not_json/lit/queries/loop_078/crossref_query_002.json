Understanding these interrelationships can inform the development of interventions to promote societal health (2) Methods: D\/PMH was defined as a diagnosis of depression and\/or more than 14 days of poor mental health in the previous month. Those reporting poor physical health for more than 14 days in the previous month or categorising their physical health as \u2018fair\u2019 or \u2018poor\u2019 were deemed to have PG\/PPH. Seven categorical questions based on subscales in the Child and Youth Resilience Measure-28 were used to define PCEs.(3) Results: Increased ACEs exposure use significantly associated with increased odds of D\/PHM (p&amp;amp;lt;0.001), increased odds of PG\/PHH (p=0.010) and decreased odds of AR-SES (p&amp;amp;lt;0.001). Increased exposure to PCEs was significantly associated with decreased odds of D\/PHM (p&amp;amp;lt;0.001), increased odds of PG\/PHH (p&amp;amp;lt;0.001) and decreased odds of AR-SES (p&amp;amp;lt; 0.001). For all outcomes, exposure to PCEs reduced the strength of the association between ACEs and outcomes. (4) Conclusions: A positive dose response between the number of ACEs and adult D\/PMH, PG\/PPH and lower AR-SES exists within the Australian population. PCEs weaken this association, demonstrating their mitigating potential. PCEs promoted adult outcomes, irrespective of ACEs.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.20944\/preprints202407.1731.v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,7,23]],"date-time":"2024-07-23T17:08:27Z","timestamp":1721754507000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Positive Childhood Experiences and Adult Mental, Relational and Physical Health in an Australian Sample: Associations Across Adverse Childhood Experiences"],"prefix":"10.20944","author":[{"given":"Stacy","family":"Blythe","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Thu","family":"Huynh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1829-9093","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Emma L","family":"Elcombe","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0806-1230","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nicole","family":"Peel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0348-1837","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lynn","family":"Kemp","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1968","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,7,23]],"date-time":"2024-07-23T17:14:24Z","timestamp":1721754864000},"score":40.391197,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.preprints.org\/manuscript\/202407.1731\/v1"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2024,7,22]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.20944\/preprints202407.1731.v1","published":{"date-parts":[[2024,7,22]]},"subtype":"preprint"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,10,11]],"date-time":"2025-10-11T00:24:30Z","timestamp":1760142270729,"version":"build-2065373602"},"reference-count":106,"publisher":"Cambridge University Press (CUP)","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2025,10,10]],"date-time":"2025-10-10T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1760054400000},"content-version":"unspecified","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/"}],"content-domain":{"domain":["cambridge.org"],"crossmark-restriction":true},"short-container-title":["Dev Psychopathol"],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n\t  <jats:p>Theoretical perspectives propose that positive childhood experiences (PCEs) are associated with adult mental health symptoms. The aim of the current study was to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the correlations between PCEs and adult mental health symptoms. 41 unique studies (<jats:italic>N<\/jats:italic> = 74,492) were included. Significant, negative, medium-to-large, effects were observed between PCEs and each mental health symptom (medium-to-large for overall mental health: <jats:italic>r<\/jats:italic> = \u2212.268; and depression: <jats:italic>r<\/jats:italic> = \u2212.273; for anxiety: <jats:italic>r<\/jats:italic> = \u2212.246; and PTSD: <jats:italic>r<\/jats:italic> = \u2212.243), indicating that higher levels of PCEs are linked to fewer mental health difficulties in adulthood. Meta-regression analyses identified current age at the time of mental health assessment and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) as significant moderators. Specifically, the promotive effects of PCEs were stronger among younger adults and weakened with higher ACEs exposure, particularly in relation to overall adult mental health symptoms, depression, PTSD, and anxiety. In contrast, no significant moderation effects were found for sex or the type of PCEs measurement tool used. Integrated prevention frameworks that combine ACEs prevention with PCEs promotion can enhance mental health across the lifespan by addressing both risk and promotive pathways and providing developmentally tailored support.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/s0954579425100734","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,10,10]],"date-time":"2025-10-10T08:56:08Z","timestamp":1760086568000},"page":"1-16","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/policypage","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Positive childhood experiences and adult mental health symptoms: A meta-analysis"],"prefix":"10.1017","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6779-2573","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yijing","family":"Zhang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/047s2c258","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Maryland"}]}],"member":"56","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2025,10,10]]},"reference":[{"key":"S0954579425100734_ref25","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.amepre.2015.02.001"},{"key":"S0954579425100734_ref81","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/21676968241237558"},{"key":"S0954579425100734_ref106","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/1090198113493782"},{"key":"S0954579425100734_ref38","article-title":"Validity and reliability of the benevolent childhood experiences (BCEs) scale in Turkish","volume":"33","author":"Gunay-Oge","year":"2020","journal-title":"Dusunen Adam-Journal of Psychiarty and Neurological Sciences"},{"key":"S0954579425100734_ref18","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/cdev.13968"},{"key":"S0954579425100734_ref12","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3390\/socsci3020242"},{"key":"S0954579425100734_ref44","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1146\/annurev-psych-010213-115057"},{"key":"S0954579425100734_ref46","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/07481187.2025.2476985"},{"key":"S0954579425100734_ref62","first-page":"271","volume-title":"Developmental psychopathology: Risk, resilience, and intervention","author":"Masten","year":"2016"},{"key":"S0954579425100734_ref83","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.7554\/eLife.92700"},{"key":"S0954579425100734_ref14","unstructured":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2016).

Simultaneous multiple regression path analysis (PROCESS) was used to test two moderation and mediation models.\nResults: Results indicate that ACEs were weakly associated with higher rates of anxious attachment and reduced self-rated mental health. Anxious attachment mediated the relation between ACEs and self-rated emotional support and self-rated mental health. PCEs were weakly negatively associated with anxious and avoidant attachment and interacted with ACEs in their effect on emotional support in adulthood. The strongest associations were found in the negative pathways between the two attachment styles (anxious and avoidant), emotional support, and self-rated mental health.\nConclusions: These findings can guide (therapeutic) interventions for individuals with a history of child adversity: interventions could focus on addressing insecure attachment, involve a person\u2019s social network as well as recognize and support the potential role of positive childhood experiences as protective factors.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.5708\/ejmh.19.2024.0031","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,11,25]],"date-time":"2024-11-25T03:50:09Z","timestamp":1732506609000},"page":"1-19","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Effect of Adverse and Positive Childhood Experiences, Attachment, and Emotional Support on Adult Mental Health"],"prefix":"10.5708","volume":"19","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8311-1272","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Metka","family":"Kuhar","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4737-3659","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Elizabeth","family":"Dorrance-Hall","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6340-406X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Simona","family":"Prosen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"3688","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,11,21]]},"reference":[{"key":"5796","unstructured":"<p> <\/p>"},{"key":"5797","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"<p>Afifi, T.

Research on positive childhood experiences (PCEs) as counterparts to childhood adversity has surged in the last five years. A systematic review of the additive and interactive effects of childhood adversity and PCEs across adult outcomes is needed that contextualizes the long-term correlates of childhood experiences within a developmental perspective. Objective: The current review synthesizes the empirical evidence for PCEs as resilience factors for a range of adult outcomes. Methods: Articles published until May 2023 were systematically identified according to PRISMA Guidelines through PubMed and PsycINFO databases and references of included articles. Then, 131 records were screened, and 58 studies were included. Results: Higher levels of PCEs were significantly but modestly associated with lower levels of childhood adversity. Higher levels of PCEs were associated with outcomes reflecting mental health, psychosocial functioning, physical health and health behaviors, and psychosocial stress. Most studies found direct, promotive effects of PCEs for more favorable outcomes. Few studies found significant interaction effects between childhood adversity and PCEs on outcomes, suggesting that PCEs may more frequently directly promote positive outcomes rather than moderate the effects of adversity on outcomes. Conclusions: Individuals\u2019 childhood adversity and PCEs are somewhat independent sets of experiences; many individuals experience both, and the presence of one does not preclude the other. PCEs predict more favorable outcomes independent of childhood adversity more often than they interact with and moderate the effects of adversity on outcomes. Although the literature base is steadily growing, more research on PCEs in diverse and international samples is needed.<\/p>","DOI":"10.31234\/osf.io\/4ne6q","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,12]],"date-time":"2023-07-12T05:00:15Z","timestamp":1689138015000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["A systematic review of positive childhood experiences and adult outcomes: Promotive and protective processes for resilience in the context of childhood adversity"],"prefix":"10.31234","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8952-6265","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Deborah","family":"Han","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7716-5602","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Nathalie","family":"Dieujuste","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2857-0817","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Jenalee","family":"Doom","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Angela","family":"Narayan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"15934","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,12]],"date-time":"2023-07-12T05:00:15Z","timestamp":1689138015000},"score":35.26003,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/osf.io\/4ne6q"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,11]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/4ne6q","published":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,11]]},"subtype":"preprint"},{"institution":[{"name":"American Psychological Association","acronym":["APA"]}],"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2024,2,14]],"date-time":"2024-02-14T00:36:04Z","timestamp":1707870964712},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"American Psychological Association (APA)","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"DOI":"10.1037\/e621642012-134","type":"dataset","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,17]],"date-time":"2013-04-17T19:28:07Z","timestamp":1366226887000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Distinctive Contributions of Adverse Childhood Experiences and Resilience Resources: A Cohort Analysis of Adult Physical and Mental Health"],"prefix":"10.1037","author":[{"given":"Patricia","family":"Logan-Greene","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Dario","family":"Longhi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sara","family":"Green","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Paula S.","family":"Nurius","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"15","container-title":["PsycEXTRA Dataset"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,2,13]],"date-time":"2024-02-13T17:45:39Z","timestamp":1707846339000},"score":35.209064,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/doi.apa.org\/doi\/10.1037\/e621642012-134"}},"subtitle":["(621642012-134)"],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"references-count":0,"alternative-id":["621642012-134"],"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1037\/e621642012-134","published":{"date-parts":[[2012]]}}],"items-per-page":10,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":"positive childhood experiences adult mental health resilience"}}}
