Resilience is an individual characteristic that is known to help negate the effect of adversities and potentially transform toxic stress into tolerable stress. Having access to a trusted adult during childhood is critical to helping children build resiliency. Here, we aim to understand the relationship between always having access to trusted adult support and childhood resilience resources, and examine which sources of personal adult support and the number of sources of adult support, best foster childhood resilience.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>A Welsh national cross-sectional retrospective survey (n\u2009=\u20092497), using a stratified random probability sample. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews at participants\u2019 places of residence by trained interviewers. Analyses use chi-square and binary logistic regression methods. Outcome measures were childhood resilience resources, access to an always-available trusted adult, and sources of personal adult support.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Prevalence of access to an always-available trusted adult decreased with increasing number of ACEs from 86.6% of individuals with no ACEs, to 44.4% of those with four or more ACEs (\u2265\u20094). In addition, for those experiencing \u2265\u20094 ACEs, individuals with no access to a trusted adult were substantially less likely than those with access, to report childhood resilience resources. For example, for individuals with \u2265\u20094 ACEs, those with access to an always-available trusted adult were 5.6 times more likely to have had supportive friends and 5.7 times more likely to have been given opportunities to develop skills to succeed in life, compared to those with no access to a trusted adult. When looking at sources of personal adult support, resilience levels increased dramatically for those individuals who had either one parent only or two parents as sources of support, in comparison to those without parental support.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Analyses here suggest strong relationships between elements of childhood resilience, constant access to trusted adults and different sources of personal adult support. While the eradication of ACEs remains unlikely, actions to strengthen childhood access to trusted adults may partially ease immediate harms and protect future generations.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.1186\/s40359-021-00601-x","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,27]],"date-time":"2021-06-27T13:02:27Z","timestamp":1624798947000},"update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":21,"title":["Adult support during childhood: a retrospective study of trusted adult relationships, sources of personal adult support and their association with childhood resilience resources"],"prefix":"10.1186","volume":"9","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6907-5102","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kathryn","family":"Ashton","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alisha R.","family":"Davies","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Karen","family":"Hughes","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kat","family":"Ford","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Andrew","family":"Cotter-Roberts","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mark A.","family":"Bellis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,27]]},"reference":[{"issue":"4","key":"601_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"245","DOI":"10.1016\/S0749-3797(98)00017-8","volume":"14","author":"VJ Felitti","year":"1998","unstructured":"Felitti VJ, Anda RF, Nordenberg MD, Williamson DF, Spitz AM, Edwards V, Koss MP, Marks JS.

We know a good deal about what constitutes risk for children, the outcomes of that risk and the processes that work to translate difficult childhoods into difficult adulthoods - for some children. We also all know children who seem to have 'weathered' the most appalling childhoods and to have emerged strong and resilient and who do not repeat the patterns of relating they experienced as children in their adult lives. It is this group that is the focus of the study. A purposively selected sample of eight, seven women and one man, with a range of backgrounds, was interviewed in depth using qualitative research methods informed by feminist standpoint theory. All of the eight had identified as having experienced significant violence as children, mainly in their families of origin. They also stated that they did not currently relate to their partners or children in violent ways, nor were they the victims of violent relationships. They consequently fell into the category of those who have \"broken the cycle\" of intergenerational abuse. Each person identified the things that helped them through their experiences and their reflections were then examined in more detail in the context of other studies on resilience. The interviews yielded an interesting array of findings which were consistent with literature which identifies certain attributes of the person and of their environment as protective. Findings are discussed with a view to their relevance to social work practice and policy. The list of protective factors may serve as an 'inventory' of potential resources for those working in the field of family violence. This study supports earlier work which challenges the idea of the inevitability of the intergenerational transmission of abuse, working instead from a paradigm which suggests that there are a multiplicity of 'resilience factors,' both integral to the individual and environmental, which interact in complex ways to enable many people to survive abuse and to relate in healthy ways in their adult lives.&lt;\/p&gt;<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.26686\/wgtn.16999015","type":"dissertation","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,12]],"date-time":"2021-11-12T11:26:32Z","timestamp":1636716392000},"approved":{"date-parts":[[1998,1,1]]},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["From Risk to Resilience: Adult Survivors of Childhood Violence Talk About Their Experiences"],"prefix":"10.26686","author":[{"sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Judith","family":"Douglas","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"11224","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,12]],"date-time":"2023-04-12T00:52:52Z","timestamp":1681260772000},"score":24.950562,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/openaccess.wgtn.ac.nz\/articles\/thesis\/From_Risk_to_Resilience_Adult_Survivors_of_Childhood_Violence_Talk_About_Their_Experiences\/16999015\/1"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[null]]},"references-count":0,"aliases":["10.26686\/wgtn.16999015.v1"],"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.26686\/wgtn.16999015"}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":"childhood trusted adult resilience"}}}
