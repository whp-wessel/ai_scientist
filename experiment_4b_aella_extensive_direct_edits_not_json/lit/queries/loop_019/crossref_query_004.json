religious coping is an essential part of dealing with the unique stressors related to HIV, surprisingly little research exists in this population. Particularly, the impact of negative aspects of religious coping in people with HIV has received little attention. The aims of this study were to examine the differential effects of positive and negative dimensions of religious coping on depression and quality of life, and to investigate the mediating role of benefit finding in the link between religious coping and psychological outcomes. One hundred and ninety eight individuals with an HIV or AIDS diagnosis in the eastern urban area of Philadelphia were included in the study. Positive and negative religious coping styles, depressive symptoms, quality of life, and benefit finding were measured in addition to demographic and clinical characteristics including ethnicity, education, religious affiliation, current mental treatment, CD4 cell count, and time since diagnosis. As hypothesized, negative religious coping was significantly associated with a high level of depressive symptoms and a lower level of quality of life after controlling for relevant demographic and clinical variables. Positive religious coping was significantly associated with positive domains of outcome measures such as positive affect, life satisfaction, and provider trust, although there was no significant association between positive religious coping and overall depressive symptoms or quality of life. A mediation analysis revealed that benefit finding fully mediates the relationship between positive religious coping and positive affect as well as life satisfaction. Furthermore, benefit finding significantly suppressed the positive association between positive religious coping and overall depressive symptoms, which is why positive religious coping was not significantly associated with overall depressive symptoms. Results suggest that positive and negative religious coping may have differential effects on psychological adjustment in people with HIV: Negative religious coping may contribute to adverse effects on general emotional distress and maladjustment, whereas positive religious coping may facilitate positive aspects of psychological adaptation. The finding that benefit finding mediates the effects of positive religious coping on increased positive psychological aspects, but suppressed emotional distress, implies that people with HIV may benefit from interventions that incorporate benefit finding in addition to spirituality.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.17918\/etd-3845","type":"dissertation","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]],"date-time":"2021-07-16T02:00:11Z","timestamp":1626400811000},"approved":{"date-parts":[[2012,6]]},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Religious

The goal of this study is to measure the influence of age, job status, and education level on both scores within Iranian infertile women.\r\nMethod: In this cross sectional study, 1000 women (mean age, 35.96; range, 26-45), who are recruited from different hospitals of Shiraz (Iran), are selected via multistage cluster sampling method. The reliability and validity of the translated versions of the questionnaires have been confirmed. The correlation coefficient (Spearman method), adjusted linear regression coefficient, and ordinal regression coefficient of demographic features with the depression scores\/levels (minimal, mild, moderate, and severe) and religious coping scores are determined.\r\nResults: A significant negative correlation is found between depression and religious compatibility scores in 1000 infertile women (\u03c1 = -0.318, P = 0.000). In addition, the results have implied the existence of a significant correlation and linear relationship between religious coping and age and job status (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, both correlation and ordinal regression of depression intensity with both job status and education level are found to be statistically meaningful (P &lt; 0.05).\r\nConclusion: The negative correlation between religious coping and depression scores has implied the positive role of religious coping in protecting infertile women from depression, especially among employed women. Nevertheless, the correlation of religious coping with education level is not strong enough due to the nonuniform distribution of variables through their range.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.18502\/ijps.v15i2.2685","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,21]],"date-time":"2020-04-21T08:23:41Z","timestamp":1587457421000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Relation of Religious Coping and Depression Levels in Infertile Women"],"prefix":"10.18502","author":[{"given":"Naemeh","family":"Honarvar","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mahsa","family":"Taghavi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"7770","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,17]]},"container-title":["Iranian Journal of Psychiatry"],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/publish.kne-publishing.com\/index.php\/IJPS\/article\/download\/2685\/1962","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/publish.kne-publishing.com\/index.php\/IJPS\/article\/download\/2685\/1962","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,17]],"date-time":"2024-12-17T15:56:39Z","timestamp":1734450999000},"score":24.161194,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/publish.kne-publishing.com\/index.php\/IJPS\/article\/view\/2685"},"secondary":[{"URL":"http:\/\/ijps.tums.ac.ir\/index.php\/ijps\/article\/view\/1847","label":"UNIVERSITY"},{"URL":"https:\/\/publish.kne-publishing.com\/index.php\/IJPS\/article\/view\/2685","label":"PUBLISHER"}]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,17]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.18502\/ijps.v15i2.2685","ISSN":["1735-4587","2008-2215"],"issn-type":[{"type":"electronic","value":"1735-4587"},{"type":"print","value":"2008-2215"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,17]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,3,12]],"date-time":"2025-03-12T04:12:38Z","timestamp":1741752758335,"version":"3.38.0"},"reference-count":67,"publisher":"SAGE Publications","issue":"3","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2013,9,1]],"date-time":"2013-09-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1377993600000},"content-version":"tdm","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/page\/policies\/text-and-data-mining-license"}],"content-domain":{"domain":["journals.sagepub.com"],"crossmark-restriction":true},"short-container-title":["Review of Religious Research"],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2013,9]]},"abstract":"<jats:p> This paper builds upon previous research on the association between religiosity and depressive symptomatology in young adults by focusing on the coping aspects of religious involvement (use of beliefs, comfort seeking, and prayer). Data come from a representative sample of Miami-Dade County, Florida, youths interviewed initially at around age 11 and then at age 19 to 21 ( N = 1,210). OLS regression models demonstrate an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relationship between religious coping and depression which, in subgroup analyses, applies only to females, and specifically to those young women reporting above-average stress exposure who had attended religious services at least once a week during their middle school years. No association is found among those reporting lower stress exposure or less frequent pre-teenage service attendance. These results provide evidence that early religious exposure on a regular basis and high global stress exposure may be essential preconditions for a relationship at the aggregate level between current religious coping and depressive symptomatology in young adults. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007\/s13644-013-0110-9","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,2,10]],"date-time":"2013-02-10T09:55:26Z","timestamp":1360490126000},"page":"413-433","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Religious Coping and Depression in Young Adulthood: Effects of Global Stress Exposure and Pre-Teenage Religious Service Attendance"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"55","author":[{"given":"A.

Previous research has shown that spiritual and religious (S\/R) factors both positively and negatively relate to mental health issues among survivors of CSA, but mediating mechanisms of effect are unclear. The present study examined CSA, anxiety, depression, and positive\/negative religious coping among 372 Jewish community members with and without CSA histories. Individuals who experienced CSA endorsed significantly higher anxiety and depression as well as negative religious coping than those without CSA. Negative religious coping mediated the relationship between CSA and anxiety and depression. We discuss clinical and social implications of these findings, including the need to address S\/R factors in treatment of CSA, especially within religious communities. Further research examining abuser identity, survivors\u2019 disclosure experience, and other S\/R mediators of effect is warranted. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/08862605211001462","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]],"date-time":"2021-03-17T12:13:50Z","timestamp":1615983230000},"page":"NP12838-NP12856","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Childhood Sexual Abuse, Spirituality\/Religion, Anxiety and Depression in a Jewish Community Sample: the Mediating Role of Religious Coping"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"37","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0527-4580","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Miriam D.","family":"Korbman","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Long Island University Post, Brookville, NY, USA"}]},{"given":"Steven","family":"Pirutinsky","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Touro College, New York, NY, USA"}]},{"given":"Eva L.","family":"Feindler","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Long Island University Post, Brookville, NY, USA"}]},{"given":"David H.","family":"Rosmarin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA, USA"}]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]]},"reference":[{"key":"bibr1-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/0886260509340533"},{"issue":"2","key":"bibr2-08862605211001462","first-page":"50","volume":"50","author":"Blau Y.","year":"2017","journal-title":"Tradition"},{"key":"bibr3-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.2307\/1602523"},{"issue":"2","key":"bibr4-08862605211001462","first-page":"60","volume":"50","author":"Brofsky D.","year":"2017","journal-title":"Tradition"},{"key":"bibr5-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1037\/a0029282"},{"key":"bibr6-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1207\/s15327957pspr0901_4"},{"key":"bibr7-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1348\/014466501163904"},{"key":"bibr8-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/1077559596001004003"},{"key":"bibr9-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1542\/peds.2013-2166"},{"key":"bibr10-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1207\/s15327582ijpr0703_6"},{"key":"bibr11-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s11205-009-9553-3"},{"key":"bibr12-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1037\/a0036465"},{"key":"bibr13-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/135910539900400306"},{"key":"bibr14-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/0886260514535094"},{"key":"bibr15-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1037\/0735-7028.21.5.325"},{"key":"bibr16-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jadohealth.2013.12.026"},{"key":"bibr17-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.chiabu.2006.01.003"},{"key":"bibr18-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1002\/j.1556-6676.1996.tb01861.x"},{"key":"bibr19-08862605211001462","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1097\/00004583-199703000-00010"},{"journal-title":"Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis: A regression-based approach","year":"2017","author":"Hayes A.
