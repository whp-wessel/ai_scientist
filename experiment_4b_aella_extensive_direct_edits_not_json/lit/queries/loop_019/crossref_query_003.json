This study aimed to compare and prioritize different methods of collection and decontamination of healthcare waste in decentralized health centers in Iran. Methods: In this descriptive-analytical research, we studied various methods of collecting and decontaminating the healthcare waste of decentralized healthcare centers in Iran in terms of administrative, health, economic and environmental. Also, the opinions and the preferences of experts for selecting each method were collected and analyzed. Results: According to environmental health experts, health issues had the highest priority for decontamination of waste from decentralized health centers. Waste collection by special vehicles with the help of the private sector and transfer to centralized disinfection centers is the best method of collecting waste (33%). Also, decontamination by autoclave was the most desirable method (56%) of decontamination. According to the experts\u2019 opinions, landfilling is the most harmful, and autoclave\/hydroclave is the least harmful method to the climate and soil. Based on the environmental health experts, the health aspect was the most important priority in waste management of decentralized healthcare centers (54%). Conclusion: The most appropriate way to decontaminate this type of waste is autoclaving after collection at a centralized location. It is suggested that further studies be conducted on modern collection and disinfection systems along with localization and determination of workplace health policies.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.32598\/jaehr.9.4.1217","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,5]],"date-time":"2022-03-05T12:59:04Z","timestamp":1646485144000},"page":"277-284","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.32598\/nsp.crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Comparing and Prioritizing Different Methods of Collection and Decontamination of Waste in Decentralized Healthcare Centers"],"prefix":"10.34172","volume":"9","author":[{"name":"Student Research Committee, Faculty of Health, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Fatemeh","family":"Ostadi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Fatemeh","family":"Mortezazadeh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Faculty of Health, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Fathollah","family":"Gholami-Borujeni","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Faculty of Health, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"20123","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2121,10,1]]},"container-title":["Journal of Advances in Environmental Health Research"],"link":[{"URL":"http:\/\/jaehr.muk.ac.ir\/article_137299_ede6d7c0a250d78a84fe934105007546.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,14]],"date-time":"2023-11-14T16:04:08Z","timestamp":1699977848000},"score":6.012611,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http:\/\/jaehr.muk.ac.ir\/article_137299.html"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2121,10,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"4","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2121,10,1]]}},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.32598\/jaehr.9.4.1217","ISSN":["2676-3478","2345-3990"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"2676-3478"},{"type":"electronic","value":"2345-3990"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2121,10,1]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,4,30]],"date-time":"2025-04-30T11:29:47Z","timestamp":1746012587525},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Maad Rayan Publishing Company","issue":"4","content-domain":{"domain":["www.niscpub.com"],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["JAEHR"],"abstract":"<jats:p>Background: Wastewater collection, treatment, discharge, additionally as reusing the treated wastewater in urban are critical factors for maintaining public health preventing contamination of water resources. This study aimed to investigate the performance of enhanced modified Ludzack Ettinger process-oxic settling anaerobic (MLE-OSA) process for treating real municipal wastewater in Sari wastewater Treatment, Sari City, Iran. Methods: To combine the OSA process technique with the MLE system, the Sludge Holding Tanks (SHT) were implemented in the return sludge line of designed pilot studies which comprised 1) MLE, which was regarded as the control system similar; 2) MLE-OSA4 with a 70-L SHT operated at 4-h Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), and 3) MLEOSA6 with a 107-L SHT operated at 6-h HRT. To start the process, the overflow effluent of the primary settling tank of the Sari wastewater treatment plant was used. After 45-60 days, the reactors reached a steady state. The parameters of Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP), temperature, pH, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and nutrients were analyzed. Results: The results revealed that the average TSS, COD, BOD, phosphorus, nitrite, nitrate, and total nitrogen in MLEOSA4 effluent decreased 20.1, 14.6, 2.97, 10, 51.1, 19.3, and 20.7%, respectively compared to MLE. Similarly, in MLE-OSA6, the values decreased 34.2, 16.1, 14.6, 16.7, 69.6, 31.3, and 25.8%, respectively compared to the control process.

These limits include complex physical concepts, and their evaluation requires light measuring instruments equipped with a blue light hazard function filter, which is not available at the moment in developing countries. This study aims to assess retinal blue light hazard using the correlated color temperature of Light-Emitting Diode (LED) light sources. Methods: In this study, a new method was proposed for evaluating the retinal blue light hazard using only the Correlated Color Temperature (CCL) of LED light sources for which concern on blue light hazard has currently been reinforced. In the proposed method, the radiometric quantity (blue light effective radiance) in W.m-2.sr-1 was converted to the corresponding photometric quantity (blue light effective luminance) in lm.m-2.sr-1. Then a computer code was developed for relevant calculations. Results: The estimated permissible exposure times applying the new photometry approach were highly reliable and supported by the literature.

Conclusion: Based on the results, serious measures are recommended to control traffic congestion in Tehran to prevent cancer risk and other health hazards caused by heavy metal bonded TSP (total suspended particulate matter).<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.32598\/jaehr.9.4.1219","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,5]],"date-time":"2022-03-05T12:59:04Z","timestamp":1646485144000},"page":"285-298","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.32598\/nsp.crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Investigating the Non-carcinogenic Risk and Hazard Quotient of Heavy Metals in High-traffic Districts of Tehran Metropolis, Iran"],"prefix":"10.34172","volume":"9","author":[{"name":"Department of Environment Engineering, North Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Azam","family":"Mahdipour","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mojgan","family":"Zaeimdar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Department of Environment Engineering, North Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mohammad Sadegh","family":"Sekhavatjou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Agriculture and Natural Resources Department, Islamic Azad University, Ahwaz Branch, Ahwaz, Iran.","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sayed Ali","family":"Jozi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Department of Environment Engineering, North Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"20123","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2121,10,1]]},"container-title":["Journal of Advances in Environmental Health Research"],"link":[{"URL":"http:\/\/jaehr.muk.ac.ir\/article_140970_2024777123f96bf27e30853cd2710bcf.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,14]],"date-time":"2023-11-14T16:04:09Z","timestamp":1699977849000},"score":2.3322456,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http:\/\/jaehr.muk.ac.ir\/article_140970.html"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2121,10,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"4","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2121,10,1]]}},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.32598\/jaehr.9.4.1219","ISSN":["2676-3478","2345-3990"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"2676-3478"},{"type":"electronic","value":"2345-3990"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2121,10,1]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,10,17]],"date-time":"2025-10-17T14:21:11Z","timestamp":1760710871036},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Maad Rayan Publishing Company","issue":"4","content-domain":{"domain":["www.niscpub.com"],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["JAEHR"],"abstract":"<jats:p>Background: Investigating human health during work importantly affect the safety and efficiency of the society. Different types of activity, including industrial, constructional, heavy duty ones, etc., affect the health of workers during their activities. In this study, the Multi-Objective Decision-Making (MODM) method was combined with fuzzy TOPSIS to investigate and optimize the air pollution risk affecting the health and safety of construction workers of Lar City, Fars Province, Iran. Methods: The comparison matrices (binary) and the Phillips\u2013Perron test of different criteria and sub-criteria of health risk, including safety view, safety efficiency, understanding the risk, and risk investigation, were assessed to find the most influential factors for the optimization of the health risk of the workers. Results: Accordingly, the results indicated that \u201cunderstanding the risk\u201d followed by \u201csafety efficiency\u201d affected the health risk of the construction workers the most. However, among the sub-criteria, the most effective ones were \u201cworker knowledge\u201d, \u201cmanager knowledge\u201d, \u201clogistic specialized managers\u201d, \u201cmodern facilities\u201d, and \u201cmodern technology\u201d. The selection of the linear and non-linear models was conducted according to the F values, and the model parameters were estimated using the Newton-Raphson test. Most coefficients were significant at P= 0.99. The model also has a high describing value of 0.97. The final estimated homogeneity coefficient was equal to 1.31, and it ranged from 0.86 to 2.72 for the critical risk investigation. The significance of the present research is to increase the health and safety of workers during work resulting in a more sustainable and healthier environment. Conclusion: Accordingly, the managers could handle the risks, determine the tolerable risks, indicate the risk of each process to control expenses, and take the essential measures for optimization.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.32598\/jaehr.9.4.1229","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,5]],"date-time":"2022-03-05T12:59:04Z","timestamp":1646485144000},"page":"265-276","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.32598\/nsp.crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Investigation and Optimization of Air Pollution Risk by a Multi-criteria Decision Making Method Using Fuzzy TOPSIS: A Case Study of Construction Workers"],"prefix":"10.34172","volume":"9","author":[{"name":"Department of Environmental Engineering, Ahvaz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ahvaz, Iran.","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Eghbal","family":"Sekhavati","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Reza","family":"Jalilzadeh Yengejeh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Department of Environmental Engineering, Ahvaz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ahvaz, Iran.","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"20123","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2121,10,1]]},"container-title":["Journal of Advances in Environmental Health Research"],"link":[{"URL":"http:\/\/jaehr.muk.ac.ir\/article_137302_5a2abc057f45e8b8c76cc79388cbe205.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,14]],"date-time":"2023-11-14T16:04:10Z","timestamp":1699977850000},"score":2.8080602,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http:\/\/jaehr.muk.ac.ir\/article_137302.html"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2121,10,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"4","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2121,10,1]]}},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.32598\/jaehr.9.4.1229","ISSN":["2676-3478","2345-3990"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"2676-3478"},{"type":"electronic","value":"2345-3990"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2121,10,1]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2024,11,20]],"date-time":"2024-11-20T05:16:42Z","timestamp":1732079802846,"version":"3.28.0"},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Scientific Research and Community Ltd","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["J Eng App Sci Technol"],"DOI":"10.47363\/jeast\/2021\/vid\/1006","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,11,19]],"date-time":"2024-11-19T06:35:09Z","timestamp":1731998109000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["ANALYTICAL CLOUD SYSTEM ERI Digital health analysis using Spectral analysis in AI \u00a0"],"prefix":"10.47363","author":[{"given":"Elena","family":"van Dijk","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"23602","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2121,4,30]]},"container-title":["Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences Technology"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,11,19]],"date-time":"2024-11-19T06:35:10Z","timestamp":1731998110000},"score":4.036671,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.srcscholarsmedia.com\/video-article\/analytical-cloud-system-eri-10.html"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2121,4,30]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.47363\/jeast\/2021\/vid\/1006","ISSN":["2634-8853"],"issn-type":[{"value":"2634-8853","type":"print"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2121,4,30]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2024,8,7]],"date-time":"2024-08-07T14:27:40Z","timestamp":1723040860172},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Negah Scientific Publisher","issue":"1","content-domain":{"domain":["www.niscpub.com"],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["JCCNC"],"abstract":"<jats:p>Background: Organizational characteristics are the main concerns of nursing practice in acute care settings.

Methods: This was a descriptive and correlational study. A purposive sampling technique was used to collect the necessary data from the study respondents. In total, 173 of the 204 eligible registered nurses providing sudden, urgent, and emergency direct care to patients in the identified acute care settings of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital in Sagamu City, Nigeria participated in this study. A self-structured 38-item questionnaire, including 4 parts (demographic characteristics, knowledge on FTR, competence in averting FTR, &amp; organizational factors) was employed for data collection. The obtained data were analyzed in SPSS V. 22 using descriptive statistics (i.e. frequency, percentages, mean, standard deviation, &amp; tables) as well as Spearman\u2019s Rho correlation to test the hypotheses based on the assumptions that the variables were measured on an ordinal scale at P&lt;0.05. Results: Most nurses presented a high level of knowledge regarding FTR with a mean score of 5.91. Besides, they were moderately competent in averting FTR with a mean score of 29.3. A significant correlation was also detected between organizational characteristics and the studied nurses\u2019 level of competence in averting FTR (P=0.026).
