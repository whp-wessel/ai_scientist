Diagnosis and Assessment, Epidemiology and Prevalence, Risk Factors, Treatment, and Prevention are addressed in this entry. Although depression in children is relatively rare, in adolescence the incidence of depression increases considerably, with a rate of about 5.7 percent, although studies vary. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM (American Psychiatric Association 2013, cited under Diagnosis and Assessment), describes and categorizes mental disorders and is widely used by mental health professionals in the United States. The depressive disorders that pertain to adolescents include major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, and disruptive mood dysregulation. Major depressive disorder describes at least a two-week period during which a person experiences a depressed mood or loss of interest in nearly all life activities, with five or more symptom categories being represented. Persistent depressive disorder represents a general personality style featuring ongoing symptoms that are similar to, but less intense than, those of major depression. A new diagnosis created in the fifth edition of the DSM, (the DSM-5) is disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, which is a twelve-month pattern of behavior that is experienced daily, consisting of temper outbursts and irritable and angry mood starting before the age of ten. The system used outside of the United States and worldwide for classifying both mental health and medical conditions is the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), published by the World Health Organization (see World Health Organization 1992, cited under Diagnosis and Assessment). The depressive disorders and their criteria are similar between the, with some minor differences.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780195389678-0244","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,28]],"date-time":"2016-11-28T09:20:43Z","timestamp":1480324843000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Adolescent Depression"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Jacqueline","family":"Corcoran","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"286","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,28]]},"container-title":["Social Work"],"original-title":["Adolescent Depression"],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,23]],"date-time":"2021-09-23T19:35:18Z","timestamp":1632425718000},"score":21.55724,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/oxfordbibliographies.com\/view\/document\/obo-9780195389678\/obo-9780195389678-0244.xml"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,28]]},"ISBN":["9780195389678"],"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/obo\/9780195389678-0244","published":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,28]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2024,5,7]],"date-time":"2024-05-07T00:36:16Z","timestamp":1715042176418},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Oxford University Press","isbn-type":[{"value":"9780190243180","type":"print"},{"value":"9780190620813","type":"electronic"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2016,6]]},"abstract":"<p>This chapter discusses the development of an interpersonally oriented depression prevention program for adolescents, Interpersonal Psychotherapy\u2013Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST). Depression is a common and debilitating illness that rises in prevalence during the teenage years. Adolescence is therefore an opportune time to provide preventive interventions to reduce the burden of depression. IPT-AST is an adaptation of interpersonal psychotherapy, an empirically supported treatment for adult and adolescent depression. The program targets interpersonal risk and protective factors that have been linked to depression in adolescence. IPT-AST is an appropriate program for adolescents with different levels of risk for depression and can be implemented in diverse settings, such as schools, primary care offices, afterschool programs, and community organizations.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/med:psych\/9780190243180.003.0001","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,29]],"date-time":"2016-09-29T13:53:03Z","timestamp":1475157183000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Importance
