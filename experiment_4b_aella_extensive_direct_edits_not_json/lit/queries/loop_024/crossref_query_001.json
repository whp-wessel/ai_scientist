Few studies have explored the association between the above two in patients with cardiovascular disease(CVD). In addition, it is not clear whether childhood friendship plays an intermediary role between childhood parents' depressive symptoms and adult depressive symptoms.\nMethods\n  In our study, we selected people suffering from CVD who participated in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) life history survey and 2018 wave of CHARLS national baseline survey. We made statistical analysis on the assumption that childhood friendship was the mediator between childhood parental depression and adult depressive symptoms. Multi-level logistic regression analysis and Sobel Goodman mediation test were used to measure the association between childhood parental depression, childhood friendship and adult depressive symptoms.\nResults\n A total of 5565 participants were included in our study. The proportion of people with CVD having significant depressive symptoms accounted for 43.94%, which was higher than that of total population in the same period(36.62%, <italic>p<\/italic>&lt;0.05). The results of logistic regression analysis showed that childhood parental depressive symptoms increased the risk of adult depressive symptoms(Model 3, <italic>OR<\/italic>: 1.621, 95%<italic>CI<\/italic>: 1.387\u20131.895). In contrast, childhood friendship was a protective factor for adult depressive symptoms (Model 3, <italic>OR<\/italic>: 0.788, 95%CI: 0.685\u20130.906), and played an intermediary role between childhood parental depressive symptoms and adult depressive symptoms. Through the Sobel-Goodman test, we found that the mediating effect of childhood friendship between the other two accounted for 6.14% of the total effect (<italic>p<\/italic>\u2009&lt;\u20090.001).\nConclusions\n In middle-aged and elderly Chinese with CVD, childhood friendship is a protective factor of adult depressive symptoms, and it is the mediator between childhood parental depression and adult depressive symptoms.<\/p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-4548466\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,7,18]],"date-time":"2024-07-18T15:55:04Z","timestamp":1721318104000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Protective Role of Childhood Friendship on the Effects of Parental Depressive Symptoms and Adult Depressive Symptoms among People with Cardiovascular Disease"],"prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"given":"Ruoyun","family":"Yin","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Chengdu Seventh People's Hospital \/ Chengdu Cancer Hospital"}]},{"given":"Hongxia","family":"Cai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Chengdu Seventh People's Hospital \/ Chengdu Cancer Hospital"}]},{"given":"Huan","family":"Xiong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Chengdu Seventh People's Hospital \/ Chengdu Cancer Hospital"}]},{"given":"Xiujuan","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Chengdu Seventh People's Hospital \/ Chengdu Cancer Hospital"}]}],"member":"297","reference":[{"key":"ref1","unstructured":"1.

Participants represented US adults transitioning from young adulthood to adulthood.

Outcome measures included self-reported diagnoses of obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease as well as serum elevations in non\u2013high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (\u2265160 mg\/dL) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP &amp;amp;gt;3 mg\/L), a marker of inflammation used to estimate risk of future coronary events. Using sampling weights, incident development of each outcome was modeled as a function of parental incarceration, adjusting for participant- and neighborhood-level characteristics.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"ab-hoi230038-8\"><jats:title>Results<\/jats:title><jats:p>This study included 9629 participants representing 16\u202f077\u202f108 US adults. Approximately half of participants were women (5498 [weighted 50.3%]) and the majority (5895 [weighted 71.4%]) were White. The mean participant age was 37.8 years (95% CI, 37.5 to 38.0 years) in wave V compared with 28.9 years (95% CI, 28.6 to 29.1 years) in wave IV. In wave V, those with childhood exposure to parental incarceration had lower educational attainment (91 [weighted 8.2%] vs 245 [weighted 4.2%] completing less than high school), had higher rates of public insurance (257 [weighted 20.6%] vs 806 [weighted 11.0%]), and were disproportionately Black (374 [weighted 22.5%] vs 1488 [weighted 13.6%]). Parental incarceration was associated with 33% higher adjusted odds (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.68) of developing hypertension and 60% higher adjusted odds (95% CI, 1.03 to 2.48) of developing elevated hsCRP.
