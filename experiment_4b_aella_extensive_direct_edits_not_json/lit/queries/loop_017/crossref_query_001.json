This study aims to determine the role of health perception and religious participation on the tendency of depression in the elderly.\nMethods\nThis study uses secondary data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) Wave 5 in 2014. The tendency of depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)-8, while health perception and religious participation were measured using single items. The study participants were 2,560 elderly (aged 60\u2013101 years). Data analysis used multiple regression analysis.\nResult\nThe findings in the study indicate that health perception and religious participation together have a role in the tendency of depression in the elderly in Indonesia. The simultaneous effective contribution is 4.3%. When viewed partially, the effective contribution of health perception to the tendency of depression is 4.28%, and the rest is by religious participation to the tendency of depression.\nConclusion\nThis study shows that health perception and religious participation play a role in the tendency of depression in the elderly, including in all elderly groups.<\/p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-7238766\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,8,27]],"date-time":"2025-08-27T08:08:41Z","timestamp":1756282121000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Role of Health Perception and Religious Participation on Depression Tendency in the Elderly"],"prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"given":"Any Elvia","family":"Jakfar","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Nusa Putra University"}]},{"given":"Arum","family":"Febriani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Gadjah Mada University"}]}],"member":"297","reference":[{"author":"Brocklehurst J","key":"ref1","unstructured":"Brocklehurst J.
