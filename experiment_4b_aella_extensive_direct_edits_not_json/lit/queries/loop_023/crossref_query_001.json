Participants were 1,255 adults (56.9% female). Childhood parental warmth was reported retrospectively at mean age 46; resting HF-HRV was measured at mean age 57; cardiovascular health and self-evaluated health were assessed at mean age 57 and 63, and mortality records extracted at mean age 63. Results revealed a positive association between childhood parental warmth and resting HF-HRV, as well as associations between higher HF-HRV and reduced risk of having a later cardiovascular health problem and of mortality by age 63. Mediation analyses revealed a small significant indirect effect of parental warmth, through HF-HRV, on cardiovascular health.<\/p>","DOI":"10.31234\/osf.io\/gjt94","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,3]],"date-time":"2020-08-03T12:29:28Z","timestamp":1596457768000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Childhood Parental Warmth and Heart Rate Variability in Midlife: Implications for Health"],"prefix":"10.31234","author":[{"given":"Nicholas","family":"Van Alen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Richard P.","family":"Sloan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Teresa E.","family":"Seeman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8703-3347","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Camelia","family":"Hostinar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"15934","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,3]],"date-time":"2020-08-03T13:48:38Z","timestamp":1596462518000},"score":32.264748,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gjt94"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,3]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/gjt94","published":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,3]]},"subtype":"preprint"}],"items-per-page":1,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":"childhood parental warmth adult mental health"}}}
