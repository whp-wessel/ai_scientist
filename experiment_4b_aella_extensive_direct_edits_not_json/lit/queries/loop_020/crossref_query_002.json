Causal estimates were derived on the association between childhood maltreatment and mental health conditions from a meta-analysis of quasi-experimental studies. This was combined with the prevalence of maltreatment from the ACMS to calculate the population attributable fraction (PAF). The PAF was applied to the number and burden of mental health conditions in Australia, sourced from 2 population-based, nationally representative surveys of Australians aged 16 to 85 years, to generate the number and associated burden of mental disorders attributable to child maltreatment.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"ab-yoi240017-7\"><jats:title>Exposure<\/jats:title><jats:p>Physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, or neglect prior to age 18 years.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"ab-yoi240017-8\"><jats:title>Main Outcomes and Measures<\/jats:title><jats:p>Proportion and number of cases, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years of mental health conditions (anxiety, depression, harmful alcohol and drug use, self-harm, and suicide attempt) attributable to childhood maltreatment.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"ab-yoi240017-9\"><jats:title>Results<\/jats:title><jats:p>Meta-analytic estimates were generated from 34 studies and 54\u202f646 participants and applied to prevalence estimates of childhood maltreatment generated from 8503 Australians.

More than 1.8 million cases of depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders could be prevented if childhood maltreatment was eradicated. Maltreatment accounted for 66\u202f143 years of life lost (95% CI, 43\u202f313-87\u202f314), primarily through suicide, and 184\u202f636 disability-adjusted life-years (95% CI, 109\u202f321-252\u202f887).<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"ab-yoi240017-10\"><jats:title>Conclusions and Relevance<\/jats:title><jats:p>This study provides the first estimates of the causal contribution of child maltreatment to mental health in Australia.
