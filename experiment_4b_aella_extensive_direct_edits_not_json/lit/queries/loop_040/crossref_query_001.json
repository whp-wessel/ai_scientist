xml:lang=\"en\">The acquirement of a disability (e.g., spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, amputation, multi trauma) is a risk factor for psychological disturbance (e.g., depression). Research has established that social support and secure attachment are protective factors against psychological disturbance. Attachment patterns have also been associated with differences in perceived social support. Secure attachment and higher perceived social support have been implicated in greater levels of resilience but need to be validated with a population of individuals who have acquired a disability. The Experiences in Close Relationships, Social Provisions Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Personal Health Questionnaire - 9 Depression Scale, and a Demographic were administered to 102 adult inpatients at a rehabilitation hospital undergoing an individualized rehabilitation program. Two MANOVAs were conducted to examine the direct associations of attachment classifications with the major dependent variables, as well as the various social support subscales. Path analysis tested two mediational models suggested by literature. Model 1 assessed the mediating role of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance on the effect of social support on depression and resilience. Model 2 assessed the mediating role of social support on the effect of attachment anxiety or attachment avoidance on depression and resilience. Partial support was obtained for both models based on fit indices. A small but significant difference in the fit of the models was found, favoring Model 1. Clinical and research implications for this population and the limitations of the study are discussed.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.12794\/metadc30452","type":"dissertation","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,7,5]],"date-time":"2025-07-05T15:04:12Z","timestamp":1751727852000},"approved":{"date-parts":[[2010,8]]},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Effects of Adult Romantic Attachment and Social Support on Resilience and Depression in Patients with Acquired Disabilities"],"prefix":"10.12794","author":[{"sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zane","family":"Dodd","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"5261","reference":[{"key":"metadc30452-001","unstructured":"Ainsworth, M., Blehar, M., Waters, E., & Wall, S.
