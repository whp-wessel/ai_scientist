Participants were 1,255 adults (56.9% female). Childhood parental warmth was reported retrospectively at mean age 46; resting HF-HRV was measured at mean age 57; cardiovascular health and self-evaluated health were assessed at mean age 57 and 63, and mortality records extracted at mean age 63. Results revealed a positive association between childhood parental warmth and resting HF-HRV, as well as associations between higher HF-HRV and reduced risk of having a later cardiovascular health problem and of mortality by age 63. Mediation analyses revealed a small significant indirect effect of parental warmth, through HF-HRV, on cardiovascular health.<\/p>","DOI":"10.31234\/osf.io\/gjt94","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,3]],"date-time":"2020-08-03T12:29:28Z","timestamp":1596457768000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Childhood Parental Warmth and Heart Rate Variability in Midlife: Implications for Health"],"prefix":"10.31234","author":[{"given":"Nicholas","family":"Van Alen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Richard P.","family":"Sloan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Teresa E.","family":"Seeman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8703-3347","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Camelia","family":"Hostinar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"15934","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,3]],"date-time":"2020-08-03T13:48:38Z","timestamp":1596462518000},"score":32.268692,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/osf.io\/gjt94"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,3]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/gjt94","published":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,3]]},"subtype":"preprint"},{"institution":[{"name":"Research Square"}],"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,3,18]],"date-time":"2025-03-18T04:07:54Z","timestamp":1742270874026,"version":"3.40.1"},"posted":{"date-parts":[[2025,3,17]]},"group-title":"In Review","reference-count":93,"publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2025,3,17]],"date-time":"2025-03-17T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1742169600000},"content-version":"unspecified","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"accepted":{"date-parts":[[2025,3,10]]},"abstract":"<title>Abstract<\/title>\n        <p>While previous research suggests that interparental conflict (IPC) influences aggression, the mechanisms through which it occurs remain underexplored. This study examines the relationship between childhood exposure to IPC and reactive aggression in emerging adulthood, with a focus on the mediating roles of parental warmth and emotional dysregulation. Data were collected from 152 participants aged 18 to 29, using a combination of well-validated instruments to measure IPC, emotional dysregulation, reactive aggression, and perceived parental warmth from mothers and fathers. Results indicate maternal warmth emerged as a key mediator, especially for females, whereas emotional dysregulation played a stronger mediating role among Chinese participants. Paternal warmth and emotional dysregulation did not significantly mediate the relationship. These findings underscore the protective role of maternal emotional support in mitigating the adverse effects of IPC on aggression, with notable variations across gender and cultural contexts. The study highlights the importance of interventions targeting maternal warmth and emotional regulation, particularly in cultures where emotional suppression is prevalent, to reduce the long-term impact of IPC on aggressive behavior.<\/p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-6195416\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,3,17]],"date-time":"2025-03-17T09:31:11Z","timestamp":1742203871000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Effects of childhood inter-parent conflict on reactive aggression in emerging adulthood: the role of parental warmth, and emotional dysregulation"],"prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0008-7913-8964","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Fangqing","family":"Liu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of Manchester"}]},{"given":"Xiaoshan","family":"Yin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of Edinburgh"}]}],"member":"297","reference":[{"issue":"2","key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"217","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cpr.2009.11.004","article-title":"Emotion-regulation strategies across psychopathology: A meta-analytic review","volume":"30","author":"Aldao A","year":"2010","unstructured":"Aldao A, Nolen-Hoeksema S, Schweizer S (2010) Emotion-regulation strategies across psychopathology: A meta-analytic review.

Parents (n = 96) completed questionnaires at 3\u20135 months, 15\u201317 months, and 31\u201333 months post-placement. We hypothesised that: (1) children adopted from care would have experienced more ACEs than children in the general population; (2) the number of ACEs would be associated with higher internalising symptom and externalising problem scores; and (3) adoptive parental warmth would moderate the relationship between ACEs and post-placement internalising symptoms and externalising problems. Nearly half (42%) of the children experienced four or more ACEs. Internalising symptoms and externalising problems were significantly higher than the UK general population. The number of ACEs was associated with internalising symptoms 3 years post-adoptive placement but this relationship was moderated by adoptive parental warmth. This study profiles the experiences and characteristics of a national sample of adopted children and highlights the potential importance of parent warmth as a factor that ameliorates the impact of ACEs on poor child outcomes.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/ijerph16122212","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,24]],"date-time":"2019-06-24T02:37:40Z","timestamp":1561343860000},"page":"2212","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/mdpi_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":67,"title":["Adverse Childhood Experiences of Children Adopted from Care: The Importance of Adoptive Parental Warmth for Future Child Adjustment"],"prefix":"10.3390","volume":"16","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9503-9562","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rebecca E.","family":"Anthony","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Public Health Improvement (DECIPHer), School of Social Sciences, Cardiff University, 1-3 Museum Place, Cardiff CF10 3BD, UK"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9025-3719","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Amy L.","family":"Paine","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Tower Building, 70 Park Place, Cardiff CF10 3AT, UK"}]},{"given":"Katherine H.","family":"Shelton","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Tower Building, 70 Park Place, Cardiff CF10 3AT, UK"}]}],"member":"1968","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,22]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref_1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"245","DOI":"10.1016\/S0749-3797(98)00017-8","article-title":"Relationship of childhood abuse and household dysfunction to many of the leading causes of death in adults\u2014The adverse childhood experiences (ace) study","volume":"14","author":"Felitti","year":"1998","journal-title":"Am.

Research in developmental psychopathology highlights emotion regulation (ER) and parenting as critical processes for fostering childhood adjustment, though their transactional dynamics remain underexplored. This study examines the bidirectional relationship between child ER and parental warmth during early childhood and investigates how their interconnected development predicts behavioral problems by school age. The sample, drawn from the longitudinal ELISA project, comprised 2,341 children (48.2% girls; ages 3\u201310). A Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM) was employed to distinguish individual-level differences from within-person changes, providing a more nuanced perspective. Results indicated stable individual differences in ER and parental warmth over time, even accounting for sociodemographic and temperamental factors. At the within-person level, bidirectional relations emerged: children\u2019s emotional competencies influenced parental warmth, while parental warmth fostered children\u2019s emotional skills. These reciprocal cycles predicted later behavioral outcomes. Specifically, carry-over changes in ER significantly predicted both conduct and emotional problems, whereas carry-over changes in parental warmth predicted only emotional problems. Findings are discussed in terms of the relevance of the interplay between ER and warmth in preventing internalizing and externalizing behaviors during childhood.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038\/s41598-025-06846-5","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,7,2]],"date-time":"2025-07-02T04:40:35Z","timestamp":1751431235000},"update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Unraveling the dynamics of emotional regulation and parental warmth across early childhood: prediction of later behavioral problems"],"prefix":"10.1038","volume":"15","author":[{"given":"Aim\u00e9","family":"Isdahl-Troye","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Paula","family":"Villar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mar\u00eda","family":"\u00c1lvarez-Voces","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Estrella","family":"Romero","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2025,7,2]]},"reference":[{"key":"6846_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"353","DOI":"10.1080\/15374416.2018.1504298","volume":"49","author":"MC Finsaas","year":"2020","unstructured":"Finsaas, M.
