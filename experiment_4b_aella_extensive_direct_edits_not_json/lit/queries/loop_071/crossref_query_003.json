The purpose of this study is to examine whether the deleterious long-term effects of childhood adversity on adult mental health are reduced for individuals who are involved in religious practices. Using longitudinal data from a representative sample of American adults ( N = 1,635), I find that religious salience and spirituality buffer the noxious effects of childhood abuse on change in positive affect over time. By contrast, these stress-buffering properties of religion fail to emerge when negative affect serves as the outcome measure. These results underscore the importance of religion as a countervailing mechanism that blunts the negative impact of childhood abuse on adult mental health over time. I discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for views about religion, childhood adversity, and mental health. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/0164027516686662","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,7]],"date-time":"2017-01-07T14:58:35Z","timestamp":1483801115000},"page":"155-179","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":23,"title":["Childhood Adversity, Religion, and Change in Adult Mental Health"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"40","author":[{"given":"Jong Hyun","family":"Jung","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"}]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,5]]},"reference":[{"volume-title":"Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interaction effects","year":"1991","author":"Aiken L.
