This study examines the relationship between childhood exposure to IPC and reactive aggression in emerging adulthood, with a focus on the mediating roles of parental warmth and emotional dysregulation. Data were collected from 152 participants aged 18 to 29, using a combination of well-validated instruments to measure IPC, emotional dysregulation, reactive aggression, and perceived parental warmth from mothers and fathers. Results indicate maternal warmth emerged as a key mediator, especially for females, whereas emotional dysregulation played a stronger mediating role among Chinese participants. Paternal warmth and emotional dysregulation did not significantly mediate the relationship. These findings underscore the protective role of maternal emotional support in mitigating the adverse effects of IPC on aggression, with notable variations across gender and cultural contexts. The study highlights the importance of interventions targeting maternal warmth and emotional regulation, particularly in cultures where emotional suppression is prevalent, to reduce the long-term impact of IPC on aggressive behavior.<\/p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-6195416\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,3,17]],"date-time":"2025-03-17T09:31:11Z","timestamp":1742203871000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Effects of childhood inter-parent conflict on reactive aggression in emerging adulthood: the role of parental warmth, and emotional dysregulation"],"prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0008-7913-8964","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Fangqing","family":"Liu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of Manchester"}]},{"given":"Xiaoshan","family":"Yin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of Edinburgh"}]}],"member":"297","reference":[{"issue":"2","key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"217","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cpr.2009.11.004","article-title":"Emotion-regulation strategies across psychopathology: A meta-analytic review","volume":"30","author":"Aldao A","year":"2010","unstructured":"Aldao A, Nolen-Hoeksema S, Schweizer S (2010) Emotion-regulation strategies across psychopathology: A meta-analytic review.

Child outcomes of parenting profiles were also examined. Participants consisted of 458 emerging adults who completed questionnaires at age 19 (51% female, 33% from single families, 74% college students). Latent profile analyses were conducted separately for mothers and fathers, and profiles included \u201cwarm helicopter\u201d parents (77% of mothers, 50% of fathers), \u201ccontrolling helicopter\u201d parents (20% of mothers, 12% of fathers), \u201clow-involved\u201d parents (3% of both mothers and fathers), \u201caverage\u201d fathers (30%), and \u201chigh controlling helicopter\u201d fathers (4%). Parenting profiles were differentially associated with children\u2019s school engagement, depression, and delinquency. Discussion focused on the relatively low salience of helicopter parenting in relation to other aspects of parenting and the implications for emerging adult children\u2019s development. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/2167696818823626","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,17]],"date-time":"2019-01-17T03:02:28Z","timestamp":1547694148000},"page":"132-144","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":80,"title":["Profiles of Helicopter Parenting, Parental Warmth, and Psychological Control During Emerging Adulthood"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"9","author":[{"given":"Laura M.","family":"Padilla-Walker","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"}]},{"given":"Daye","family":"Son","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"}]},{"given":"Larry J.","family":"Nelson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"}]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,16]]},"reference":[{"key":"bibr1-2167696818823626","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.2307\/353953"},{"key":"bibr2-2167696818823626","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1037\/0003-066X.55.5.469"},{"volume-title":"The Clark University poll of emerging adults: Thriving, struggling, and hopeful","year":"2012","author":"Arnett J.
