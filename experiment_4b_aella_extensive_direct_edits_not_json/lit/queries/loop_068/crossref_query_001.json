The social integration\/regulation perspective of Durkheim (1966) has been the dominant theoretical link between religion and suicide; the sheer numbers of religious rituals and beliefs are seen as critical to suicide prevention (e.g., Stack, 1980; Kowalski, Faupel, &amp; Starr, 1987). Others have contended that a few key aspects of religion may be enough to lower suicide risk (Stark, Doyle, &amp; Rushing, 1983; Stack, 1983b); this is the religious commitment view. A relatively new \u201cnetworks\u201d approach explores factors such as the organizational aspects of religious bodies (hierarchical structure, primary group ties, and the like) in order to assess suicide risk (Pescosolido &amp; Georgianna, 1989). This chapter reviews each of these theories and the empirical literature associated with them. It treats the special problem of religion and depression in a shorter section, and a conclusion provides a summary and suggestions for future research.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780195069853.003.0006","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,6]],"date-time":"2023-11-06T04:43:58Z","timestamp":1699245838000},"page":"87-97","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":18,"title":["Religiosity, Depression, and Suicide"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Steven","family":"Stack","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"286","container-title":["Religion and Mental Health"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/book\/chapter-pdf\/52596468\/isbn-9780195069853-book-part-6.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,10,28]],"date-time":"2025-10-28T05:27:31Z","timestamp":1761629251000},"score":20.557915,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/book\/50090\/chapter\/422710376"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1992,10,15]]},"ISBN":["9780195069853","9780197740767"],"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/oso\/9780195069853.003.0006","published":{"date-parts":[[1992,10,15]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2024,9,10]],"date-time":"2024-09-10T13:23:06Z","timestamp":1725974586393},"edition-number":"1","reference-count":1,"publisher":"Routledge","isbn-type":[{"type":"electronic","value":"9780429472848"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,17]]},"DOI":"10.4324\/9780429472848-1","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,23]],"date-time":"2018-11-23T19:14:07Z","timestamp":1543000447000},"page":"3-17","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Childhood Depression Project"],"prefix":"10.4324","author":[{"given":"Judith","family":"Trowell","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Emilia","family":"Dowling","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"301","reference":[{"key":"ref1","unstructured":"MISSING-VALUE"}],"container-title":["Childhood Depression"],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,4]],"date-time":"2021-04-04T14:01:03Z","timestamp":1617544863000},"score":20.08206,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.taylorfrancis.com\/books\/9780429897610\/chapters\/10.4324\/9780429472848-1"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,17]]},"ISBN":["9780429472848"],"references-count":1,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4324\/9780429472848-1","published":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,17]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2024,9,6]],"date-time":"2024-09-06T02:50:10Z","timestamp":1725591010209},"publisher-location":"Berlin\/Heidelberg","reference-count":0,"publisher":"Springer-Verlag","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"DOI":"10.1007\/springerreference_69818","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,20]],"date-time":"2012-01-20T13:10:42Z","timestamp":1327065042000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Childhood Depression"],"prefix":"10.1007","member":"297","container-title":["SpringerReference"],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,20]],"date-time":"2012-01-20T13:12:19Z","timestamp":1327065139000},"score":20.010303,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http:\/\/www.springerreference.com\/index\/doi\/10.1007\/SpringerReference_69818"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[null]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/springerreference_69818"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,27]],"date-time":"2022-12-27T06:13:15Z","timestamp":1672121595126},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Opast Group LLC","issue":"4","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["JNH"],"abstract":"<jats:p>Childhood depression is a significant public health issue that requires special attention due to the severe and long-lasting effects it has on a child\u2019s development. The diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis of childhood depression were all topics examined in recent studies. Recent scientific studies on paediatric depression tend to emphasise the detrimental effects of depressive illnesses on children\u2019s quality of life, either directly or indirectly.Sadly, research from the past demonstrates that juvenile depression frequently develops against a backdrop of vulnerability and poverty, where personal and social needs related to childhood melancholy are not always taken into account. In this regard, this review established that co-morbidities and other psychiatric problems are frequently caused by childhood depression.Numerous recent research have also supported the idea that human resources, such as the healthcare system as a whole, lack the necessary training to manage paediatric depression. In order to establish programmes that will train healthcare workers to cope with childhood depression, additional research is required. Additionally, studies that focus on the prevention and treatment of juvenile depression with bigger and more homogeneous sample sizes are also required..<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.33140\/jnh.07.04.04","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,26]],"date-time":"2022-12-26T11:45:46Z","timestamp":1672055146000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Childhood Depression: - An Update"],"prefix":"10.33140","volume":"7","member":"18493","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,2]]},"container-title":["Journal of Nursing &amp; Healthcare"],"original-title":["Childhood Depression: - An Update"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,26]],"date-time":"2022-12-26T11:45:52Z","timestamp":1672055152000},"score":19.942455,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.opastpublishers.com\/open-access-articles\/childhood-depression--an-update.pdf"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,2]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"4","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,2]]}},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.33140\/jnh.07.04.04","ISSN":["2475-529X"],"issn-type":[{"value":"2475-529X","type":"electronic"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,2]]}}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":"childhood religiosity depression"}}}
