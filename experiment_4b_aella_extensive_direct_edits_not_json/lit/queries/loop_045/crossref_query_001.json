Resilience is an individual characteristic that is known to help negate the effect of adversities and potentially transform toxic stress into tolerable stress. Having access to a trusted adult during childhood is critical to helping children build resiliency. Here, we aim to understand the relationship between always having access to trusted adult support and childhood resilience resources, and examine which sources of personal adult support and the number of sources of adult support, best foster childhood resilience.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>A Welsh national cross-sectional retrospective survey (n\u2009=\u20092497), using a stratified random probability sample. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews at participants\u2019 places of residence by trained interviewers. Analyses use chi-square and binary logistic regression methods. Outcome measures were childhood resilience resources, access to an always-available trusted adult, and sources of personal adult support.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Prevalence of access to an always-available trusted adult decreased with increasing number of ACEs from 86.6% of individuals with no ACEs, to 44.4% of those with four or more ACEs (\u2265\u20094). In addition, for those experiencing \u2265\u20094 ACEs, individuals with no access to a trusted adult were substantially less likely than those with access, to report childhood resilience resources. For example, for individuals with \u2265\u20094 ACEs, those with access to an always-available trusted adult were 5.6 times more likely to have had supportive friends and 5.7 times more likely to have been given opportunities to develop skills to succeed in life, compared to those with no access to a trusted adult. When looking at sources of personal adult support, resilience levels increased dramatically for those individuals who had either one parent only or two parents as sources of support, in comparison to those without parental support.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Analyses here suggest strong relationships between elements of childhood resilience, constant access to trusted adults and different sources of personal adult support. While the eradication of ACEs remains unlikely, actions to strengthen childhood access to trusted adults may partially ease immediate harms and protect future generations.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.1186\/s40359-021-00601-x","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,27]],"date-time":"2021-06-27T13:02:27Z","timestamp":1624798947000},"update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":21,"title":["Adult support during childhood: a retrospective study of trusted adult relationships, sources of personal adult support and their association with childhood resilience resources"],"prefix":"10.1186","volume":"9","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6907-5102","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kathryn","family":"Ashton","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alisha R.","family":"Davies","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Karen","family":"Hughes","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kat","family":"Ford","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Andrew","family":"Cotter-Roberts","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mark A.","family":"Bellis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,27]]},"reference":[{"issue":"4","key":"601_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"245","DOI":"10.1016\/S0749-3797(98)00017-8","volume":"14","author":"VJ Felitti","year":"1998","unstructured":"Felitti VJ, Anda RF, Nordenberg MD, Williamson DF, Spitz AM, Edwards V, Koss MP, Marks JS.

Research has established that social support and secure attachment are protective factors against psychological disturbance. Attachment patterns have also been associated with differences in perceived social support. Secure attachment and higher perceived social support have been implicated in greater levels of resilience but need to be validated with a population of individuals who have acquired a disability. The Experiences in Close Relationships, Social Provisions Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Personal Health Questionnaire - 9 Depression Scale, and a Demographic were administered to 102 adult inpatients at a rehabilitation hospital undergoing an individualized rehabilitation program. Two MANOVAs were conducted to examine the direct associations of attachment classifications with the major dependent variables, as well as the various social support subscales. Path analysis tested two mediational models suggested by literature. Model 1 assessed the mediating role of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance on the effect of social support on depression and resilience. Model 2 assessed the mediating role of social support on the effect of attachment anxiety or attachment avoidance on depression and resilience. Partial support was obtained for both models based on fit indices. A small but significant difference in the fit of the models was found, favoring Model 1. Clinical and research implications for this population and the limitations of the study are discussed.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.12794\/metadc30452","type":"dissertation","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,7,5]],"date-time":"2025-07-05T15:04:12Z","timestamp":1751727852000},"approved":{"date-parts":[[2010,8]]},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Effects of Adult Romantic Attachment and Social Support on Resilience and Depression in Patients with Acquired Disabilities"],"prefix":"10.12794","author":[{"sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zane","family":"Dodd","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"5261","reference":[{"key":"metadc30452-001","unstructured":"Ainsworth, M., Blehar, M., Waters, E., & Wall, S.
