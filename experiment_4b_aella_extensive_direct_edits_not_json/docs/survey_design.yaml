status: draft
survey_design:
  weight_variable: null  # TODO: confirm if probability weights were collected
  strata_variable: null  # TODO: populate once sampling strata are known
  cluster_variable: null  # TODO: populate if PSU/cluster IDs exist
  replicate_weights: []  # TODO: add replicate weight columns if provided
  finite_population_correction: false
assumptions:
  - "Until weights are confirmed, analyses will default to SRS with transparent caveats."
  - "Small-cell threshold k=10; suppress or aggregate cells with n<10."
  - "Design degrees of freedom will match the number of independent PSUs once clusters are documented."
validation_plan:
  - "Compare marginal distributions against external benchmarks (if available)."
  - "Recompute totals using any provided replicate weights to validate variance estimation."
  - "Record any changes to design inputs in qc/data_checks.md and analysis/decision_log.csv."
notes: >
  Placeholder file created during bootstrap. Update with authoritative survey documentation
  before freezing the pre-analysis plan. If the official codebook references weights or
  complex design elements that remain missing, stop work and escalate to a human reviewer.
