  sampling: "Treat as approximate simple random sample until sponsor provides weights."

  notes:
    - "Codebook does not reference survey weights; confirmed columns do not obviously encode probability weights."
    - "If later documentation introduces weights, pause analysis and update this file plus PAP."

  regen_command: "python -m scripts.describe_design --input docs/survey_design.yaml"
  status: "Placeholder; implement describe_design utility before confirmatory analyses."
