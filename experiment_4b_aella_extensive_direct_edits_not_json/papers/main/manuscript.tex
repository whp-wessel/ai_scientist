\begin{abstract}
This bootstrap manuscript placeholder references the planned analyses for the Childhood Resilience Study. No confirmatory results are reported yet.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
We investigate how religious adherence, parental guidance, and exposure to emotional abuse relate to adult wellbeing indicators in a convenience sample. Primary claims will be registered as [CLAIM:C1]–[CLAIM:C3] once hypotheses are frozen.
\section{Methods}
Study design details are governed by `config/agent_config.yaml`, `docs/codebook.json`, and `docs/survey_design.yaml`. Reproducible analysis scripts will live under `analysis/code/`, and every figure/table will be regenerated using commands logged in `papers/main/MANIFEST.md`.
\section{Results}
No confirmatory analysis has occurred. Exploratory summaries will be explicitly labeled and withheld from this section until the PAP is frozen and executed.
\section{Discussion}
Future drafts will synthesize findings relative to the literature captured in `lit/evidence_map.csv`.
