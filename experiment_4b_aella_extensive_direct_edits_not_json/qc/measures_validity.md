externalreligion | "In childhood, how important was adherence to the religion?" | Ordered categories: not_important < somewhat < important < very_important | NA (single item) | Planned: score distribution compared across age cohorts + gender for DIF | Predictor for H1; needs harmonized recode script to enforce ordering.
