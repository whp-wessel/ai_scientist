DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Repro checkpoint entry plus QC ledger (analysis/decision_log.csv:186, qc/data_checks.md:3, qc/data_checks.md:47) keep the canonical seed and current session/checksum timestamps, so determinism stayed auditable.
L1: PASS – Loop logged the required Semantic Scholar call and stored its 403 payload alongside the CrossRef fallback (analysis/decision_log.csv:187, analysis/decision_log.csv:188, lit/queries/loop_021/query_001.json:1, lit/queries/loop_021/crossref_query_001.json:1).
P1: PASS – n≥10 disclosure guard plus automated check references remain in force and no release occurred (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:43, qc/data_checks.md:52).
N1: PASS – Phase stays PAP with the next action explicitly blocked until the S2 gate clears (artifacts/state.json:25, artifacts/state.json:28, analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:33).

Notes: Unblock Semantic Scholar (new key or waiver) so the PAP can finally freeze (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:33).
