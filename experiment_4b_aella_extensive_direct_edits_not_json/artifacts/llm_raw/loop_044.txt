**Key Updates**
- Refreshed reproducibility artifacts before editing (`python runner.update_reproducibility()`), capturing the new env snapshot and hashes at `artifacts/session_info.txt:1` / `artifacts/checksums.json:1`, then logged the mandated Semantic Scholar attempt plus 403 payload and CrossRef fallback under `lit/queries/loop_044/query_001.json:1` and `lit/queries/loop_044/crossref_query_001.json:1`.
- Added the Bauldry (2006) mentoring evidence everywhere it matters so H2’s guidance pathway stays documented despite the outage—see `lit/evidence_map.csv:43`, `lit/bibliography.bib:482`, `lit/bibliography.json:836`, and the extended waiver trail at `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:47` & `:54`.
- Kept the PAP in draft while recording the Loop 044 blocker note plus refreshed timestamp (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1` & `:81`) and rolled the QC log to Loop 044 with the latest repro checkpoint + risk notes (`qc/data_checks.md:1` & `:46-53`); no confirmatory tables or figures were generated.
- Documented the actions in the running notebook (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:329`) and updated `artifacts/state.json:25-33` so loop_counter=44, phase remains PAP, and next action N1 now references the fresh 403 payload and upcoming ops memo/support ticket deadlines.

**Next Steps**
1. Dispatch the 2025-11-09 15:00Z ops memo (`lit/semantic_scholar_ops_memo_2025-11-09.md`) with all loop 008–044 payloads/DOIs attached once the window opens.
2. If the API key is still blocked after the memo, submit the prepared Semantic Scholar support ticket on 2025-11-10 15:00Z and document the response so the PAP gate can clear.

Status: Loop 044 completed. Repro checkpoint refreshed, Semantic Scholar still 403 (payload saved), Bauldry mentoring DOI propagated, PAP/QC/state/notebook updated, and the next priority is executing the 11-09 ops memo so the waiver/credential path keeps moving toward PAP freeze.
