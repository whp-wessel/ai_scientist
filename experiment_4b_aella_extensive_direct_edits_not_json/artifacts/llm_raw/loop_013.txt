**Loop 13 Work**
- Per reviewer L1, reran the mandated Semantic Scholar CLI search and archived the 403 payload for reproducibility (`lit/queries/loop_013/query_001.json:1`; `analysis/decision_log.csv:91`).
- Drafted `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1` to consolidate loops 008–013 failures plus the Ross et al. fallback DOI, with the action logged for governance (`analysis/decision_log.csv:92`).
- Kept the PAP in draft but added an explicit Loop 13 waiver block so freeze gating stays transparent (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1` and `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:17`).
- QC checklist, notebook narrative, and program state now reference the waiver memo and updated loop counter/backlog (`qc/data_checks.md:1`; `notebooks/research_notebook.md:129`; `artifacts/state.json:3`).
- Decision log captures the review response plus all downstream edits for this loop (`analysis/decision_log.csv:90`, `93`, `94`, `95`, `96`).

- Tests: not run (documentation-only work this loop).

Next steps:
1. Secure a working Semantic Scholar credential or obtain approval for the recorded waiver so the literature gate can clear.
2. Once unlocked, replay the queued queries, expand the evidence map, and push the PAP to `status: frozen` before any confirmatory outputs.

Loop 013 status: Logged reviewer response, reran the S2 query (still 403), drafted the waiver memo, and refreshed PAP/QC/state; next priority is restoring API access or approving the waiver so the PAP can freeze.
