**Loop Updates**
- Logged the required Semantic Scholar request and archived the 403 payload alongside the CrossRef response for the replacement DOI (`lit/queries/loop_018/query_001.json`, `lit/queries/loop_018/crossref_query_001.json`). Added Merrill & Salazar (2002) to the evidence map and both bibliographies so H1 now has current church-attendance support (`lit/evidence_map.csv:13`, `lit/bibliography.bib:136`, `lit/bibliography.json:232`).
- Kept the PAP in draft status while documenting the Loop‑018 blocker and new literature note; waiver memo now reflects 11 straight failures and cites the new source (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:27`, `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1-35`).
- Reaffirmed reproducibility controls by re-checking session info/checksums and rolling the QC checklist to Loop 018 with the updated risk entry (`qc/data_checks.md:1`, `qc/data_checks.md:50`).
- Captured all actions in the decision log and notebook so reviewers can trace the loop plan, query failure, fallback DOI, and governance refresh (`analysis/decision_log.csv:136-145`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:160-164`).
- Updated state to loop_counter 18 with N1 still blocked pending either a working key or waiver approval (`artifacts/state.json:25-33`).

**Next Steps**
1. Work with ops/reviewer to resolve the Semantic Scholar credential or secure formal waiver approval so PAP can freeze.
2. Continue documenting reproducibility checkpoints and literature fallbacks each loop while avoiding confirmatory outputs until the PAP gate clears.

Loop status (≤120 words): Recorded Loop 018 review response, reran the mandated Semantic Scholar query (still 403), and added a CrossRef-backed church-attendance study so H1 stays evidence-backed while we wait for a working key. PAP, waiver memo, QC log, decision log, notebook, and state all now capture the ongoing blocker. Next priority is unlocking Semantic Scholar access or obtaining the waiver so the PAP can finally freeze and unlock confirmatory work.
