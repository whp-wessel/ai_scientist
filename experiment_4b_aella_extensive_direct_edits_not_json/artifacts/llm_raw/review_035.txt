DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Session info/checksums were regenerated before edits and recorded with the run seed, keeping the workflow reproducible (analysis/decision_log.csv:341; artifacts/session_info.txt:1; qc/data_checks.md:46).
L1: PASS – Required Semantic Scholar attempt was logged despite the 403 and the CrossRef fallback DOI was propagated to the evidence map/bibliography (analysis/decision_log.csv:343,345; lit/queries/loop_035/query_001.json:1; lit/evidence_map.csv:33; lit/bibliography.bib:371).
P1: PASS – No disclosure-sensitive outputs were published this loop and the QC log reiterates the existing small-cell guard/violations=0 status (qc/data_checks.md:52).
N1: PASS – Phase remains `pap`, N1 stays explicitly blocked, and the PAP is still marked draft with the Loop 35 blocker note, so gating is transparent (artifacts/state.json:25,28,70; analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1,63).

Notes: Clearing the Semantic Scholar credential/waiver remains the critical path to freezing the PAP (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:63).
