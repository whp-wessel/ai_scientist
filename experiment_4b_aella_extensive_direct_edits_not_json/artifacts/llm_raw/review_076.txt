DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – The loop-076 auto-log (analysis/decision_log.csv:838) plus session_info (artifacts/session_info.txt:1-7) capture the seed, git head, and release-bundle regeneration trace so reproducibility stays intact.
L1: PASS – Review checklist and findings note the Conkbayir (2023) CrossRef fallback (lit/queries/loop_075/crossref_query_001.json; lit/evidence_map.csv:64; lit/bibliography.bib:694-695) that keeps [CLAIM:C1] DOI-backed while Semantic Scholar is offline.
P1: PASS – No new tables/figures were released; qc/disclosure_check_loop_074.md:1 plus findings_summary.md:1 still document n≥10 and `violations: 0`.
N1: PASS – artifacts/state.json records phase=release with all next actions done, and reports/findings_v2.1.md:1-3 outlines archiving/monitoring steps, so the release gate reasoning is explicit.
