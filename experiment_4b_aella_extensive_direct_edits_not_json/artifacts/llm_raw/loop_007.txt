**Key Updates**
- Logged a full transformation ledger covering DP1–DP8 with commands, seeds, and artifacts so reproducibility history is centralized (`analysis/data_processing.md:1`).
- Refreshed PAP metadata plus data-management and outstanding-task sections to cite the new ledger and reiterate the literature/disclosure gates before freeze (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:60`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:89`).
- Updated the QC checklist to Loop 007, referencing the disclosure automation, the new ledger, and the persistent Semantic Scholar blocker (`qc/data_checks.md:1`, `qc/data_checks.md:46`).
- Documented Loop 007 narrative + action items in the research notebook and logged reviewer ack/query/doc updates in the decision log (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:73`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:91`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:54`).
- Incremented the state loop counter and captured the latest 403 failure so N1 stays explicitly blocked with traceable evidence (`artifacts/state.json:3`, `lit/queries/loop_007/query_001.json:1`).

**Testing**
- `python scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py search --query "childhood resilience spirituality adult wellbeing" --limit 5 --output lit/queries/loop_007/query_001.json` (403 Forbidden expected; payload saved for audit).

**Next Steps**
1. Secure a working Semantic Scholar credential or written waiver so the PAP can satisfy the literature gate.
2. Freeze the PAP (status, registry URL, freeze commit/tag) once literature access is restored and disclosure automation is wired into every planned artifact.
3. Coordinate with the data provider regarding the empty `mentalillness` control or document a defensible omission before confirmatory modeling.

Loop Status: Logged the required literature attempt (still blocked by 403), built the DP ledger, and synchronized PAP/QC/notebook/state artifacts to keep the PAP draft reproducible. Next focus is resolving the Semantic Scholar credential so the literature gate can clear and the PAP can be frozen for confirmatory work.
