DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Seed 20251016 stays logged (artifacts/seed.txt:1) and the latest reruns (analysis/decision_log.csv:627;analysis/decision_log.csv:628;analysis/decision_log.csv:630) cover H1–H3, the negative control, and the BH adjustment so the outputs can be deterministically regenerated.
L1: PASS – loop_058’s Semantic Scholar search (lit/queries/loop_058/query_001.json:1) plus the CrossRef fallback metadata (lit/queries/loop_058/crossref_query_001.json:1) are archived and tied to the DOI-recorded entry in lit/evidence_map.csv:52, keeping the literature log compliant despite the 403.
P1: PASS – qc/disclosure_check_loop_058.md:15 reports tables/results_summary.csv’s n≥13,507 and qc/disclosure_check_loop_058.md:18 records `violations: 0`, so the small-cell threshold is enforced before any publication-ready artifact is released.
N1: PASS – artifacts/state.json:26 keeps next actions N8–N12 pending and artifacts/state.json:49 shows the phase remains “sensitivity”, so gating and the plan to integrate confirmatory/sensitivity outputs before writing stay justified.
