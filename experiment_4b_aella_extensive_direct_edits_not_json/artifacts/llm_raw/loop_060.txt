Loop 060 refreshed the confirmatory pipeline, reran all sensitivity scenarios, rebuilt the reporting-ready tables, and captured the blocked Semantic Scholar query plus a CrossRef fallback so the manuscript-ready map/plan stays deterministic (see `analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:5,16,24` and `reports/findings_summary.md:5`).

- Rebuilt the summary/BH chain so `analysis/results_pre_bh.csv:1` feeds `analysis/results.csv:1` and the new `tables/results_summary.md:1` table, keeping the same seed and injecting the numbers that will support the write-up.
- Re-ran the pseudo-weight, design-effect, and pseudo-replicate flows (`analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:16`) and refreshed the disclosure check (`qc/disclosure_check_loop_060.md:1`) so the SRS+HC1 default remains defensible with supporting outputs in `outputs/sensitivity_*`.
- Logged the 403 Semantic Scholar search (`lit/queries/loop_060/query_001.json:1`) plus the CrossRef fallback (`lit/queries/loop_060/crossref_query_001.json:1`) and added DOI 10.1080/19349637.2014.864543 to the evidence map/bibliography for `[CLAIM:C3]` (`lit/evidence_map.csv:54`, `lit/bibliography.bib:578`).
- Captured the loop actions (review response, scenario runs, table build, disclosure audit, literature update, state bump) in `analysis/decision_log.csv:667` and brought `artifacts/state.json:25-46` to `loop_counter=60` with refreshed next-action notes.

Next steps:
1. Embed the deterministic results, tables, and sensitivity outputs into `papers/main/*`/`papers/main/imrad_outline.md` and `reports/identification.md` so every `[CLAIM:<ID>]` points to these artifacts (`analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:30`).
2. Keep recording the blocked Semantic Scholar query and CrossRef fallbacks (still in `lit/queries/loop_060/…`) until the API key is restored so the evidence map stays DOI-backed (`analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:31`).
3. Refresh `qc/strobe_sampl_checklist.md`, `qc/measures_validity.md`, and the decision log so the QC ledger matches the latest confirmatory and sensitivity assets ahead of the writing/review QC suite (`analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:32`).

Status: Loop 060 wrapped up by regenerating the confirmatory outputs, rerunning the sensitivity scenarios, updating the disclosure audit, and logging the literature fallback; next priority is stitching those deterministic tables and sensitivity narratives into the manuscripts/outline (N11).
