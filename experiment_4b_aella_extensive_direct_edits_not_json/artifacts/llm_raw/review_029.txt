DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – analysis/decision_log.csv:273-281 records the loop-29 review sync plus session/checksum refresh, and qc/data_checks.md:1-55 captures the current seed, dataset counts, and regeneration commands.
L1: PASS – analysis/decision_log.csv:275-278 logs the mandated Semantic Scholar query with CrossRef fallback, lit/queries/loop_029/query_001.json:1-16 stores the 403 payload, and lit/evidence_map.csv:27 documents the Gerra cortisol DOI.
P1: PASS – qc/data_checks.md:50-54 reiterates disclosure automation with violations=0 and no new public tables were generated, so no small-cell exposures occurred this loop.
N1: PASS – artifacts/state.json:25-74 keeps the project in phase “pap” with N1 explicitly blocked by the Semantic Scholar outage, and analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-27 reaffirms status=draft plus gating requirements, making the stall well justified.

Notes: Keep pressing on the Semantic Scholar credential/waiver so PAP freeze can proceed.
