**Updates**
- `analysis/decision_log.csv:197-206` now captures the Loop 22 review sync, reproducibility checkpoint, the failed Semantic Scholar request archived at `lit/queries/loop_022/query_001.json:1`, and the CrossRef fallback stored in `lit/queries/loop_022/crossref_query_001.json:1`, keeping the waiver trail reproducible.
- Added the Taskesen et al. parental-warmth DOI across literature artifacts (`lit/evidence_map.csv:20`, `lit/bibliography.bib:224`, `lit/bibliography.json:376`) and extended the waiver memo with the loop-022 attempt plus citation (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:25,46`).
- PAP remains `status: draft` but now logs the loop-022 blocker (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-5,35`); QC and the notebook document the refreshed reproducibility check and narrative (`qc/data_checks.md:1,47,53`; `notebooks/research_notebook.md:185`), and `artifacts/state.json:25,30` reflects loop_counter=22 with backlog item N1 still blocked.

**Next Steps**
1. Restore Semantic Scholar access or secure waiver approval, then replay the queued searches to satisfy the literature gate before PAP freeze.
2. Once the gate clears, lock the PAP (registry URL + freeze commit) and ready confirmatory code paths/manifests for H1–H3.

Status: Loop 22 focused on PAP prep only—logged the reviewer sync, rechecked session/checksum artifacts, executed the required (still failing) Semantic Scholar query with a CrossRef fallback, and refreshed PAP/QC/state plus literature records. Next priority is restoring Semantic Scholar (or a waiver) so the PAP can freeze.
