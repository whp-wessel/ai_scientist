DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Repro checkpoint logged (analysis/decision_log.csv:295-304) and qc/data_checks.md confirms 2025‑11‑08 session_info/checksums refresh plus seed discipline; no stray artifacts observed.
L1: WARN – Required S2 query + payload archived (lit/queries/loop_031/query_001.json) with CrossRef fallback propagated to lit/evidence_map.csv and lit/bibliography.*, but lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md still titled “Loop 030” and its summary cites loops 008‑030 even though loop 031 is now in the attempt log—please update for consistency.
P1: PASS – No new public tables/figures; qc/data_checks.md reiterates disclosure guard status (min‑cell ≥10) and confirms no releases this loop.
N1: PASS – artifacts/state.json keeps phase=PAP with N1 marked blocked, and analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md stays `status: draft` with the loop‑031 blocker note, so gating remains justified.

Notes: Once the API waiver/key is resolved, align the waiver memo header/summary with the logged loops before attempting PAP freeze.
