Key updates:
- Logged the latest reviewer guidance plus the release-doc/state work in `analysis/decision_log.csv:821-826`, and advanced `artifacts/state.json:1-43` to loop 74 with `phase_ix=7`, `N16` done, `N17` pending, and `last_abort` cleared for the resumed release gate.
- Locked the PAP to release status and marked the confirmatory hypotheses as tested so the registry now mirrors the delivered results (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-15`, `analysis/hypotheses.csv:1-7`).
- Synced the manuscript/outline/checklists to the CrossRef fallback (Morris & Hays-Grudo 2023 via `lit/queries/loop_073/crossref_query_001.json`), updated `papers/main/manuscript.{md,tex}:30-63`, `papers/main/imrad_outline.md:1-16`, `reports/findings_summary.md:1-11`, `reports/review_checklist.md:1-12`, `reports/identification.md:1-24`, `qc/strobe_sampl_checklist.md:1-11`, and `papers/main/MANIFEST.md:16-23`, and added `reports/findings_v2.0.md:1-11` to capture the final release narrative while keeping `[CLAIM:C1]` DOI-backed under the waiver.
- Ran the n≥10 disclosure scan and TeX build, capturing the commands/output in `analysis/decision_log.csv:823-825`, `qc/disclosure_check_loop_074.md:1-13`, `papers/main/build_log.txt:3`, and `papers/main/manuscript.pdf`; the new logs record the zero-violation disclosure and the successful `tectonic --keep-logs papers/main/manuscript.tex` run (Overfull hboxes noted but unchanged, BibTeX warnings = 0).
- Refreshed the reproducibility metadata so `artifacts/session_info.txt:1-10` and `artifacts/repro_report.md:1-9` now show the current timestamp and git HEAD in this loop.

Loop status: Logged the reviewer feedback, refreshed the release-phase artifacts/dossiers, ran the disclosure check and LaTeX build, and marked state to 74 with `N17` ready; next priority is to finish the `N17` release package (final PDF/logs plus the waiver-backed CrossRef record) while monitoring `review/research_findings.md` before opening the release gate.
