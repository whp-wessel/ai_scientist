- Replayed the blocked Semantic Scholar search and captured the 403 response so the outage trail stays auditable while the credential is down (`lit/queries/loop_073/query_001.json#L1`, `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:174`).
- Logged the World Psychiatry (2023) CrossRef fallback and synchronized it with the evidence map and bibliographies so [CLAIM:C1] remains DOI-backed despite the persistent 403 (`lit/queries/loop_073/crossref_query_001.json#L1`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:63`, `lit/bibliography.bib:676`, `lit/bibliography.json:1147`).
- Refreshed the release-phase deliverables (review checklist, findings log/summary) and noted loop 073’s progress/state so `N16` stays ready while `N8` waits on a working S2 key (`reports/review_checklist.md:1`, `reports/findings_v1.9.md:1`, `reports/findings_summary.md:1`, `artifacts/state.json:26`).

Tests: not run (not requested).

Status: Replayed the blocked query, logged the CrossRef fallback, and refreshed the release-phase docs/state for loop 73; next priority is to rerun the blocked Semantic Scholar query once the S2 key is restored so `N8`/`N16` can close and the release gate can move ahead.
