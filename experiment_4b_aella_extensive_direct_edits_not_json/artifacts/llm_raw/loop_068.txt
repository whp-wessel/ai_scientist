- Reran the deterministic sensitivity suite (pseudo weights, DEFF grid, pseudo replicates) into the loop-068 directories, refreshed `analysis/sensitivity_manifest.md` and `analysis/sensitivity_plan.md`, and kept `qc/disclosure_check_loop_064.md` as the latest public audit since no new tables were released.  
- Logged the review response plus the rerun commands in `analysis/decision_log.csv`, appended a loop-068 section to `notebooks/research_notebook.md`, and updated `artifacts/state.json` (loop_counter=68, N14 still pending) so the ledger, notebook, and state mirror the new outputs.  
- Recorded a Semantic Scholar 403 plus CrossRef fallback in `lit/queries/loop_068/`, appended the CrossRef entry to `lit/evidence_map.csv`, and added the Stack (1992) chapter to `lit/bibliography.bib`/`.json` so Claim C1 stays DOI-backed while the API is blocked.  
- Documented the work in `reports/findings_summary.md`, created `reports/findings_v1.6.md`, and reiterated writing-phase QC (manuscript parity/outline/checklist/LaTeX rebuild) as the next blocking milestone.  

Status: Loop 068 reran the seeded sensitivity suite, logged the missing Semantic Scholar/CrossRef citation, refreshed the manifest/plan/reports/state/notebook, and produced the loop-specific outputs and bibliography entry; next priority is the writing-phase QC pass (manuscript parity, outline/checklist refresh, LaTeX rebuild) while keeping the literature log current.
