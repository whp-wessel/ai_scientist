**Updates**
- Logged the Loop 010 reviewer guidance in `analysis/decision_log.csv:80-82`, keeping R1/L1/P1/N1 expectations front-of-mind for this loop.
- Executed the mandatory Semantic Scholar search; the API still returns HTTP 403, and the failure payload is archived at `lit/queries/loop_011/query_001.json:1` for waiver documentation, with the attempt recorded in the decision log.
- Refreshed the PAP header/note so it stays an explicit draft tied to the latest blocked query (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-27`), updated the QC checklist with Loop 011 reproducibility checks and literature blocker tracking (`qc/data_checks.md:1-58`), and documented the same narrative in the research notebook (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:116-123`).
- Advanced `artifacts/state.json:3-66` to `loop_counter=11` while keeping the phase at PAP and flagging N1 as blocked until Semantic Scholar access is restored.

**Testing**
- Not run (literature/PAP maintenance only).

**Next Steps**
1. Secure a working Semantic Scholar key or an approved waiver so the PAP can meet the literature gate and freeze.
2. Once literature governance is cleared, finalize PAP estimands/commands and prepare for confirmatory runs plus updated disclosure checks.

Loop 11 status: Synced reviewer expectations, logged another blocked Semantic Scholar query, refreshed PAP/QC/notebook/state artifacts, and confirmed reproducibility checkpoints; priority remains restoring S2 access or obtaining a waiver so the PAP can freeze.
