DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Confirmatory reruns that summarize results, apply BH, and rebuild tables cite the seeded commands (analysis/decision_log.csv:780; analysis/decision_log.csv:781; analysis/decision_log.csv:782) while the latest LaTeX build and `artifacts/seed.txt` keep the environment reproducible (papers/main/build_log.txt:3; artifacts/seed.txt:1).
L1: PASS – The loop-069 Semantic Scholar search + CrossRef fallback are archived, and the new Poole et al. entry keeps Claim C1 DOI-backed in the evidence map and bibliography (lit/queries/loop_069/query_001.json:1; lit/evidence_map.csv:59; lit/bibliography.bib:628).
P1: PASS – The disclosure script’s seeded audit confirms `tables/results_summary` and `figures/dag_design` exceed n≥10 with zero violations (qc/disclosure_check_loop_069.md:18).
N1: PASS – State now sits in the review phase with `N15` (review checklist + artifacts) still pending, so advancement is gated until those deliverables are complete (artifacts/state.json:50; artifacts/state.json:57).
Notes: Draft `reports/review_checklist.md` and gather the review artefacts before clearing the pending gate noted at `artifacts/state.json:50`/`artifacts/state.json:54`.
