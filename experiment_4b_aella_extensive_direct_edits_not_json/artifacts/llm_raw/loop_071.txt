- Summary: Logged the loop_070 review digest plus every action (Semantic Scholar attempt, CrossRef fallback, evidence update, disclosure check, and state/Checklist refresh) in `analysis/decision_log.csv:798-806`, then aligned `reports/review_checklist.md:1-13`, `reports/findings_summary.md:1-13`, and the new `reports/findings_v1.8.md:1-14` so the release gate documents the literature/disclosure state and the new `N16` follow-up while `N8` remains pending.
- Literature: Added Jung (2018) to the evidence map and bibliographies (`lit/evidence_map.csv:60`, `lit/bibliography.bib:639`, `lit/bibliography.json:1086`) plus saved the 403 hit (`lit/queries/loop_071/query_001.json:1`) and the CrossRef payload that produced the DOI (`lit/queries/loop_071/crossref_query_003.json:1`), keeping `[CLAIM:C1]` DOI-backed while the S2 key stays blocked.
- Controls: Regenerated `qc/disclosure_check_loop_070.md:1` so `tables/results_summary.*` and `figures/dag_design.png` still exceed `n ≥ 10`, and recorded the refreshed `artifacts/state.json:26-60` (loop_counter=71, updated N8 note, added N16) to capture the release-ready next actions.
- Testing: `python analysis/code/disclosure_check.py --tables-dir tables --figures-dir figures --output-md qc/disclosure_check_loop_070.md --seed 20251016` (`qc/disclosure_check_loop_070.md:1`).

Next steps:
1. Keep the Semantic Scholar waiver (`N8`) pending until the S2 key returns, rerun the archived queries, append their responses/ticket ID to `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md`, and refresh `lit/evidence_map.csv`/`lit/bibliography.*` with any new DOIs (per `analysis/decision_log.csv:800-806`).
2. Once the literature gate clears, use `N16` to verify the review checklist, disclosure memo, DAG, and findings log/identification memo stay synchronized so the final release can proceed immediately (`reports/review_checklist.md:5-13`, `reports/findings_v1.8.md:1-14`).

Loop 71 status: Documented loop_070’s review summary, reran the disclosure audit, captured the CrossRef fallback/new evidence, and refreshed the release checklist/summary/state while logging every action; next priority is to wait for the restored S2 key so the archived Semantic Scholar calls (N8) and follow-on release consolidation (N16) can complete the final handoff.
