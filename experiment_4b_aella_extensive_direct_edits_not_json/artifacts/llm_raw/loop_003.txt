**Updates**
- Ran the PAP modeling command end-to-end (`analysis/code/run_models.py` → `outputs/run_models_loop003_*.json`). H1 shows a −0.12 average depression shift when moving from “not important” to “very important” childhood religion, while H2 highlights a +0.10 increase in Pr(very good/excellent health) for top guidance quartile even after dropping the empty `mentalillness` control (`outputs/run_models_loop003_H1.json:1-35`, `outputs/run_models_loop003_H2.json:1-24`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:33-39`).
- Generated an exploratory missingness digest via the new command block so we have both the full CSV and a QC-friendly markdown summary with several 100%‑missing administrative columns flagged for suppression planning (`qc/data_checks.md:21-31`, `qc/missingness_loop003.md:1-12`).
- Built and ran `analysis/code/measure_validity_checks.py` to populate the dossier and structured JSON. Every H1–H3 measure now carries an explicit DIF estimate (e.g., Δmale–non-male = −0.24 for the abuse indicator) with deterministic regeneration instructions (`analysis/code/measure_validity_checks.py:1-174`, `qc/measures_validity.md:1-12`, `artifacts/measurement_validity_loop003.json:1-20`).
- Synced documentation: the notebook logs Loop‑3 actions, the PAP now calls out the missing `mentalillness` control plus new tooling commands, and the outstanding-task list focuses on the remaining gates (Semantic Scholar fix, PAP freeze, DAG/disclosure work, metadata gap) (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:52-57`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:33-68`).
- Logged everything in the decision log and state tracker so reviewers can trace the loop. Backlog item B2 and next action N2 are closed, while N1 stays blocked pending a working S2 key despite the archived 403 attempt (`analysis/decision_log.csv:22-28`, `lit/queries/loop_003/query_001.json:1-11`, `artifacts/state.json:3-43`).

**Next steps**
1. Restore Semantic Scholar API access (or document an approved fallback) so we can satisfy the literature→PAP gate and unblock N1.
2. Freeze the PAP once the registry URL/freeze commit and the causal/DAG + disclosure artifacts are drafted, then proceed toward confirmatory tables with the now-tested modeling script.
