**Updates**
- Logged the Loop 019 review response, Semantic Scholar attempt, CrossRef fallback, and admin refresh trail so reproducibility stays auditable (`analysis/decision_log.csv:147`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:148`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:150`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:156`); the latest 403 payload is preserved at `lit/queries/loop_019/query_001.json:1`.
- Added the Eliassen (2013) longitudinal evidence to the machine-readable bibliography (`lit/bibliography.json:252`), documented its stress-interaction nuance in the PAP loop note (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:29`), and captured the narrative in the research notebook (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:166`) while keeping the PAP in draft.
- Extended the waiver memo through 12 blocked queries (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1`, `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:22`, `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:37`), refreshed the QC checklist with current session/checksum references plus the new DOI risk note (`qc/data_checks.md:1`, `qc/data_checks.md:47`, `qc/data_checks.md:53`), and advanced the state tracker to loop 19 with N1 still blocked (`artifacts/state.json:25`, `artifacts/state.json:30`). Confirmatory outputs remain paused.

**Tests**
- Not run (literature/QC documentation only).

**Next Steps**
1. Secure a working Semantic Scholar credential or obtain approval on the documented waiver so the PAP can freeze (`artifacts/state.json:30`).
2. Once literature gate clears, finalize PAP robustness details and prepare confirmatory scripts.

Loop 19 status (≤120 words): Reviewed the Loop 018 critique, re-ran the mandated S2 query (403), captured the Eliassen (2013) CrossRef DOI to bolster H1, refreshed the waiver/QC/PAP/notebook/state artifacts, and noted that confirmatory work remains blocked until the Semantic Scholar key or waiver clears. Priority is restoring compliant literature access so the PAP can freeze.
