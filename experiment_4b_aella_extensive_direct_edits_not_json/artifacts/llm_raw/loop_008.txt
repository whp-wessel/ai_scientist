**Updates**
- PAP header/outstanding tasks now carry the Loop 008 timestamp plus the waiver contingency so the plan remains draft until S2 access is restored (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-5,89-94).
- QC checklist rolled to Loop 008 and now logs a reproducibility checkpoint confirming the current `session_info` and checksum artifacts (qc/data_checks.md:1-54).
- Notebook captures the new Loop 008 narrative and revised Next Steps that point to the loop_008 query and escalation plan (notebooks/research_notebook.md:73-101).
- Decision log records the reviewer sync, failed query, doc refreshes, and state increment for full traceability (analysis/decision_log.csv:59-64).
- State file reflects `loop_counter=8`, keeps the phase at PAP, and leaves N1 blocked with the latest query reference (artifacts/state.json:2-35).
- Required Semantic Scholar attempt saved the 403 payload under `lit/queries/loop_008/query_001.json:1`, preserving the audit trail while credentials are denied.

**Outstanding**
- Semantic Scholar API still returns 403, so PAP freeze remains blocked until a working key or documented waiver is recorded (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:89-92; qc/data_checks.md:50-54).
- The `mentalillness` control remains empty; PAP/results must note any exclusion before confirmatory analysis (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:45,94).

1) Coordinate with ops to restore Semantic Scholar access or secure the waiver promised for Loop 010 so the PAP gate can clear.  
2) Draft registry text/freeze metadata now so the plan can flip to `status: frozen` immediately once the literature requirement is satisfied.

Loop 008 status: Logged reviewer guidance, reran the mandatory Semantic Scholar query (still 403), refreshed PAP/QC/Notebook docs, and bumped loop/state metadata; next priority is resolving the S2 credential so the PAP can finally freeze.
