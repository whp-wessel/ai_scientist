- Appended the Loop 054 review entry to `review/research_findings.md:442-448`, logging a STOP decision because the confirmatory outputs are missing and reproducibility cannot be guaranteed.
- Flagged that `analysis/results.csv` (and the derived `tables/results_summary.*`) never persisted—`outputs/reverted_paths_loop_054.txt:4` shows the writes were blocked even though `reports/findings_v1.0.md:7` and `analysis/sensitivity_manifest.md` rely on them—so the BH-corrected estimates can’t be regenerated or cited.
- Highlighted that next-action N11 (artifacts/state.json:35-38) depends on those absent files, leaving the sensitivity/writing phase stalled until the confirmatory artifacts are restored or the blocking policy is explicitly justified.

Tests: not run (not requested).
