DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Loop 072’s auto-log entry plus `artifacts/session_info.txt` and `artifacts/state.json` reference the recorded seed/environment while `analysis/decision_log.csv:808-813` preserves the commands/outputs that keep reproducibility auditable.
L1: PASS – The Semantic Scholar replay (`lit/queries/loop_072/query_001.json`), CrossRef fallback (`lit/queries/loop_072/crossref_query_001.json`), and updates to `lit/evidence_map.csv`, `lit/bibliography.{bib,json}`, and `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md` keep [CLAIM:C1] DOI-backed even while the S2 key remains blocked.
P1: PASS – No new public tables/figures were released this loop, so the latest disclosure audit (`qc/disclosure_check_loop_070.md`) with `violations: 0` continues to safeguard small-cell compliance.
N1: PASS – `artifacts/state.json` still shows phase=release with next action N8 pending (Semantic Scholar replay) and N16 queued, so holding the release gate until the credential is restored is justified.

Notes: Await OPS-S2-2025-11-09-01 key restoration before completing N8/N16 and closing the release-phase gate.
