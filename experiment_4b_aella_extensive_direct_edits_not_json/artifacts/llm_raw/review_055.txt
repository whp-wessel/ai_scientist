DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Reproducibility assets updated this loop (seed tracked in `artifacts/seed.txt`, `artifacts/session_info.txt` refreshed, PAP freeze recorded in `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`, and decision log entries note regeneration outputs).
L1: FAIL – No Semantic Scholar query was logged for loop_055 (`lit/queries/` lacks a `loop_055` directory), so the mandatory literature artifact is missing for this loop.
P1: PASS – Disclosure audit `qc/disclosure_check_loop_055.md` documents n≥10 thresholds with `violations: 0`, so no small-cell/privacy leaks occurred.
N1: PASS – `artifacts/state.json` remains in sensitivity with pending next actions (N8–N12) and no premature phase advances, which matches the gating requirements before writing.

Notes: Please run and archive the required Semantic Scholar query for loop_055 (and log it in `lit/queries/loop_055/`) before the next literature review loop.
