**Key Updates**
- Repro checkpoint + logging refreshed: `artifacts/session_info.txt:1-12`, `artifacts/checksums.json:1-9`, and `artifacts/repro_report.md:1-5` now capture the 21:37Z environment snapshot; the new decision-log rows (`analysis/decision_log.csv:395-404`) document the reviewer sync, reproducibility refresh, and downstream actions.
- Literature diligence: archived the 403 Semantic Scholar attempt and CrossRef fallback in `lit/queries/loop_040/query_001.json` and `lit/queries/loop_040/crossref_query_001.json`; registered Luecken (2000) across `lit/evidence_map.csv:39`, `lit/bibliography.bib:431`, `lit/bibliography.json:754`, and the waiver memo (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1-45`), with the rate-limit tracker updated in `artifacts/.s2_rate_limit.json:1-3`.
- Planning & QC: `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-5,73-79` now records the Loop 040 blocker plus the dated ops escalation plan (ops memo by 2025-11-09 15:00Z; S2 ticket by 2025-11-10 15:00Z); `qc/data_checks.md:1-56` mirrors the new reproducibility timestamps, literature status, and escalation commitments.
- Narrative/state: `notebooks/research_notebook.md:301-305` captures the loop summary, and `artifacts/state.json:25-33` sets `loop_counter=40`, keeps phase `pap`, and embeds the explicit escalation schedule so reviewers can trace the blocker.

**Next Steps**
1. Draft and send the ops credential memo (loops 008–040 + DOI evidence) by 2025-11-09 15:00Z, attaching the waiver log and decision-log pointers.
2. If no response, open the Semantic Scholar support ticket by 2025-11-10 15:00Z while continuing to log 403 attempts and CrossRef fallbacks so the PAP freeze gate can clear promptly.

Loop 040 status: Synced the reviewer note, refreshed reproducibility artifacts, logged the 403 Semantic Scholar query plus the Luecken (2000) fallback, and updated PAP/QC/state with the dated escalation plan. Next priority is delivering the 2025-11-09 ops memo and, if needed, the 2025-11-10 Semantic Scholar support ticket so the literature gate can clear and the PAP can freeze.
