**Updates**
- Logged the Loop 20 reviewer feedback and reproducibility checkpoint so the audit trail shows this loop’s plan (`analysis/decision_log.csv:185-186`), keeping R1 expectations satisfied without touching analytic code.
- Re-ran the required Semantic Scholar query (still 403) and captured the payload plus CrossRef fallback for parental guidance evidence; see `analysis/decision_log.csv:187-190`, `lit/queries/loop_021/query_001.json:1`, and `lit/queries/loop_021/crossref_query_001.json:1`.
- Documented that the PAP, QC checklist, waiver memo, and notebook already reflect the loop‑021 blocker, noting the verification steps in `analysis/decision_log.csv:191-194`.
- Advanced the workflow ledger by bumping `loop_counter` to 21 and refreshing the N1 blocker notes with the latest DOI coverage (`artifacts/state.json:25-33`).

**Next Steps**
1. Secure a working Semantic Scholar key or an approved waiver so the PAP can freeze.
2. Once the literature gate clears, finalize the PAP (status=frozen) and proceed to confirmatory analysis.

Loop status (≤120 words): Reviewed Loop 20 feedback, re-logged reproducibility, reran the Semantic Scholar query (still blocked) with CrossRef documentation, confirmed PAP/waiver/QC narratives remain current, and advanced `artifacts/state.json` to loop 21. Next priority is unblocking Semantic Scholar (new key or waiver approval) so the PAP can freeze.
