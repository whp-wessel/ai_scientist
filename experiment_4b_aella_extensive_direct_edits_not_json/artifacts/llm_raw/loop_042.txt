**Loop 42**
- Refreshed reproducibility artifacts (`artifacts/session_info.txt:1`, `artifacts/checksums.json:1`) and rolled the QC log with the updated Semantic Scholar risk + escalation references (`qc/data_checks.md:1`, `qc/data_checks.md:53`).
- Logged the Loop 042 Semantic Scholar failure plus CrossRef fallback (Kuhar 2024) and propagated it through the evidence map and bibliographies (`lit/queries/loop_042/query_001.json:1`, `lit/queries/loop_042/crossref_query_002.json:1`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:41`, `lit/bibliography.bib:457`, `lit/bibliography.json:797`).
- Extended the waiver ledger and drafted the ops/support escalation docs while keeping PAP, state, and notebook blockers in sync (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1`, `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:45`, `lit/semantic_scholar_ops_memo_2025-11-09.md:1`, `lit/semantic_scholar_support_ticket_draft_2025-11-10.md:1`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:77`, `artifacts/state.json:25`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:315`).
- Tests: not run (not applicable this loop).

Next steps: 1) Deliver the ops memo by 2025-11-09 15:00Z. 2) File the Semantic Scholar support ticket by 2025-11-10 15:00Z if ops is still silent. 3) Continue daily CLI attempts + CrossRef fallbacks until the literature gate clears.

Status: Logged Loop 042 review response, refreshed reproducibility checks, documented another Semantic Scholar 403 with a CrossRef fallback (Kuhar 2024), and prepared the ops memo + support ticket drafts while keeping PAP/QC/state in sync. Next priority is sending the memo by 2025-11-09 15:00Z (and ticket by 2025-11-10 if ops is still silent) so we can finally clear the literature gate and freeze the PAP.
