**Key Updates**
- `analysis/decision_log.csv:230-240` now logs the Loop 024 reviewer sync, reproducibility checkpoint, the failed Semantic Scholar call (`lit/queries/loop_025/query_001.json`), the CrossRef fallback (`lit/queries/loop_025/crossref_query_001.json`), literature/waiver refreshes, PAP/QC/notebook/state edits, and a new `ops_followup_loop025` action documenting how we will brief ops on the warmth/DERS mediator gap.
- Literature artifacts gained the Liu & Yin (2025) context: evidence map notes the mediator-coding need (`lit/evidence_map.csv:23`), the BibTeX/JSON entries include venue + “cite when coding” guidance (`lit/bibliography.bib:258-265`, `lit/bibliography.json:443-460`), and the waiver memo adds an “Ops Coordination” paragraph so support understands the blockage (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:52-55`).
- PAP + QC reference the new action plan—`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-43` updates `last_updated` and records the specific warmth/DERS mapping task, while `qc/data_checks.md:53-54` tracks the same risk so it’s gated before freeze.
- Planning context stays synchronized: `notebooks/research_notebook.md:208` documents the ops-facing task, and `artifacts/state.json:25-33` increments `loop_counter` to 25 with an expanded N1 note about preparing the escalation packet.

**Next Steps**
1. Draft the ops escalation (attach the Liu & Yin mediator specs plus the latest 403 logs) and continue daily Semantic Scholar attempts until the credential is fixed or the waiver is approved.
2. Begin scripting the maternal/paternal warmth + short-form DERS transformations so the PAP can cite reproducible commands as soon as the literature gate opens.

**Loop Status (≤120 words)**
Logged the reviewer sync and reproducibility check, ran the mandatory Semantic Scholar query (still 403) and captured the CrossRef fallback, then pushed the Liu & Yin 2025 DOI through the evidence map, bibliographies, waiver note, PAP, QC, notebook, and state. Next priority is drafting the ops escalation so the team has precise mediator-coding requirements while we keep attempting the API each loop.
