DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Repro checkpoint preceded edits (analysis/decision_log.csv:509) and refreshed env snapshot/repro report record seed 20251016 at 11:46Z (artifacts/session_info.txt:1; artifacts/repro_report.md:1).
L1: PASS – Loop-mandated Semantic Scholar attempt + CrossRef fallback captured (lit/queries/loop_050/query_001.json:1; lit/queries/loop_050/crossref_query_001.json:1) and DOI propagated into evidence map/bibliography (lit/evidence_map.csv:49; lit/bibliography.bib:553).
P1: PASS – No new public tables/figures and QC log reiterates sensitive-field guard plus prior disclosure audit (qc/data_checks.md:1; qc/data_checks.md:52), so small-cell risk stays contained.
N1: PASS – Phase stays PAP with PAP header marked draft and Loop050 blocker note tying the status to the ongoing S2 outage/ops escalation plan (artifacts/state.json:1; analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1; analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:93).

Notes: Record proof when the 2025-11-09 ops memo and 2025-11-10 support ticket go out to keep the blocker narrative auditable.
