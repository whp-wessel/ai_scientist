Rebuilt the confirmatory + sensitivity outputs, recompiled the manuscript, and logged the latest literature + state updates so the loop-063 narrative is fully deterministic and ready for the next writing-phase QC push.

- Confirmatory results and publication files now match the rerun JSONs/q-values: `analysis/results.csv:1` holds the seeded estimates/q-values, and `tables/results_summary.csv:1` presents the same summary rows at PLA-ready precision.
- Loop-063 planning and controls are documented in `analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:1` (scenario bullets, synthesis, and next steps) while `qc/disclosure_check_loop_063.md:1` certifies every listed table/figure meets the `n $\geq$ 10` rule before downstream referencing.
- LaTeX file references now use `\texttt{\detokenize{…}}` and math-mode comparisons to eliminate missing-character errors (`papers/main/manuscript.tex:13`), and the `tectonic --keep-logs papers/main/manuscript.tex` build is recorded at `papers/main/build_log.txt:2` (with the generated PDF/logs in place).
- CrossRef fallback logging keeps `[CLAIM:C1]` DOI-backed: see `lit/evidence_map.csv:56`, `lit/bibliography.bib:602`, and `lit/bibliography.json:1027` (the CrossRef JSON lives in `lit/queries/loop_063/crossref_query_001.json`), and the new loop summary propagated to `reports/findings_summary.md:1`, `reports/findings_v1.1.md:1`, and `notebooks/research_notebook.md:402`.
- Operational traceability and gating were captured in `analysis/decision_log.csv:718` (review response) and `artifacts/state.json:1` (loop_counter=63 plus the new `N14` writing-phase QC task), so the next action is clearly documented.

Tests: `python analysis/code/pseudo_weight_sensitivity.py`, `python analysis/code/summarize_results.py --json-paths outputs/run_models_loop059_H1.json outputs/run_models_loop059_H2.json outputs/run_models_loop059_H3.json`, `python analysis/code/calc_bh.py --input-csv analysis/results_pre_bh.csv --output-csv analysis/results.csv --summary-json artifacts/bh_summary.json`, `python analysis/code/design_effect_grid.py`, `python analysis/code/pseudo_replicates.py`, `python analysis/code/build_results_summary.py`, `python analysis/code/disclosure_check.py --output-md qc/disclosure_check_loop_063.md --seed 20251016`, and `tectonic --keep-logs papers/main/manuscript.tex`.

Next steps:
1. Execute the writing-phase QC pass (refresh the IMRaD outline as needed, rerun STROBE/SAMPL checks, ensure `reports/findings_v1.2.md` lines up, and prepare the DAG/identification memo) to satisfy `N14` before advancing.
2. Continue logging blocked Semantic Scholar queries plus CrossRef fallbacks and capture each in `analysis/decision_log.csv`/`lit/evidence_map.csv` so every `[CLAIM:<ID>]` remains DOI-backed while the S2 key/waiver is unresolved.
