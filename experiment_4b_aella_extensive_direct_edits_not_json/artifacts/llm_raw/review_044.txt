DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – `analysis/decision_log.csv:441-451` plus `artifacts/session_info.txt:1-10` and `artifacts/checksums.json:1-9` document the pre-edit repro checkpoint (seed 20251016) and refreshed hashes, so determinism and git hygiene are covered this loop.
L1: PASS – The required Semantic Scholar payload and CrossRef fallback are archived under `lit/queries/loop_044/query_001.json:1-18` and `lit/queries/loop_044/crossref_query_001.json:1`, and the Bauldry mentoring DOI is propagated into `lit/evidence_map.csv:43` and `lit/bibliography.bib:470-487`.
P1: PASS – No disclosure outputs shipped; `qc/data_checks.md:1-60` reiterates the sensitive-column guard and `qc/disclosure_check_loop_006.md:1-17` still reports violations = 0.
N1: PASS – `artifacts/state.json:25-69` keeps phase=pAP with N1 explicitly blocked, and `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-20,81` records the Loop 044 outage note plus the dated ops memo/support-ticket escalation, so gating rationale is transparent.

Notes: Execute the 2025-11-09 ops memo and 2025-11-10 support ticket on schedule so the literature gate can clear once responses arrive.
