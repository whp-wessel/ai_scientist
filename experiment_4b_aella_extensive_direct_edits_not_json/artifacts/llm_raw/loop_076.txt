Cleared the release gate by recording the reviewer’s `DECISION: CONTINUE` (loop 075) in the decision log, updating `artifacts/state.json` (loop_counter 76, N18 done, new N19), and rounding out release documentation so the frozen PAP now points to the verified CrossRef waiver evidence and the release package is ready for handoff.

The release bundle now includes `reports/findings_v2.1.md` (final summary), `reports/findings_summary.md` (Loop 076 narrative), `reports/review_checklist.md` (new loop and gate confirmation), and the notebook entry for loop 076. The decision log has entries for the review acknowledgment (`review_findings_loop075_ack`) and for refreshing those release docs (`release_docs_loop076`), and the notation points to `qc/disclosure_check_loop_074.md`, the CrossRef fallback, and the LaTeX build so reproducibility is traceable. Tests were not run (not requested).

Other tracked changes—`artifacts/session_info.txt`, `artifacts/repro_report.md`, and `decision_flow_diagram.md`—were already present in the working tree and remain untouched by this loop.

Next steps:
1. Archive the release artifacts (manuscript PDF, build log, disclosure audit, review checklist, `reports/findings_v2.1`) for downstream sharing while the reviewer clearance is fresh.
2. Continue logging CrossRef/waiver fallback entries for `[CLAIM:C1]` if the Semantic Scholar key returns; otherwise treat the experiment as complete until new directives arrive.

Loop 076 status: release docs (findings_v2.1, findings summary, review checklist, notebook) now cite `DECISION: CONTINUE` and the CrossRef waiver so the release gate is closed; next priority is to archive the release package and await any further instructions.
