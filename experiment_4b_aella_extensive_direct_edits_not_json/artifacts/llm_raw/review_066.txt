DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Loop 066 signal entries (pseudo_weight_sensitivity_loop066, design_effect_grid_loop066, pseudo_replicates_loop066) in `analysis/decision_log.csv` cite seed 20251016, and `artifacts/session_info.txt`/`artifacts/seed.txt` keep the deterministic environment, so reruns and manifests remain reproducible.
L1: WARN – No Semantic Scholar query files were added for loop_066 (the last recorded query is `lit/queries/loop_064/query_001.json` with DOI 10.1080/19349637.2014.864543), so literature logging hasn’t progressed while the API outage persists; log the next query as soon as access is restored.
P1: PASS – No new public tables/figures were produced, and `qc/disclosure_check_loop_064.md` (n ≥ 10 audit, `violations: 0`) still covers `tables/results_summary.csv` and `figures/dag_design.png`, keeping disclosure safeguards intact.
N1: PASS – `artifacts/state.json` still shows `phase: "sensitivity"`/`phase_ix: 3` with N14 (writing-phase QC/build prep) pending, and `reports/findings_v1.4.md` reiterates that the manuscript/checklist/build steps are the next gating actions.
