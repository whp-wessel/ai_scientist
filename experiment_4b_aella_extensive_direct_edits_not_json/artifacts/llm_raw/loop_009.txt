**Changes**
- Logged how this loop addresses reviewer priorities (R1 seed/QC, L1 literature attempts, P1 disclosure guard, N1 PAP freeze gate) plus the subsequent documentation edits so the audit trail stays current (`analysis/decision_log.csv:66`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:67`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:68`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:69`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:70`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:71`).
- Executed the required Semantic Scholar search; the 403 payload is archived for governance review and referenced throughout the plan (`lit/queries/loop_009/query_001.json:1`).
- Kept the PAP explicitly in draft with a Loop 009 blocker note tying freeze status to the unresolved S2 access issue (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:13`).
- Updated the QC checklist to Loop 009, including fresh session/checksum timestamps and reiterating the disclosure guard + S2 blocker (`qc/data_checks.md:1`, `qc/data_checks.md:46`, `qc/data_checks.md:53`).
- Notebook next steps and loop narrative now cite the latest query failure and PAP/QC refresh, while state tracking reflects loop counter 9 with N1 still blocked (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:74`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:103`, `artifacts/state.json:3`, `artifacts/state.json:35`).

**Next Steps**
1. Secure a working Semantic Scholar key or documented waiver by Loop 010 so the PAP can meet the literature gate and freeze.
2. Continue maintaining reproducibility checkpoints (session info, checksums, data-processing ledger) so the transition to confirmatory analysis is seamless once literature governance clears.

Loop status (≤120 words): Reviewed the Loop 008 critique, reran the mandatory Semantic Scholar query (403), and refreshed the PAP, QC log, notebook, and state to document that the literature gate still blocks PAP freeze. Next priority is escalating the S2 credential/waiver so we can freeze the PAP and proceed to confirmatory analysis.
