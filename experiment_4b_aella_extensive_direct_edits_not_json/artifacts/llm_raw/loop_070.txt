- Logged the loop_069 review critiques and how we’ll satisfy R1–N1 before release so that the decision history explicitly ties the latest findings to the planned checklist and state changes (`analysis/decision_log.csv:794`).
- Documented the reviewer checklist that links reproducibility, literature backup, disclosure auditing, and build log coverage to the release gate (`reports/review_checklist.md:1`).
- Advanced the experiment to the release phase with loop_counter=70 while keeping the Semantic Scholar replay action pending for future reruns, and recorded that transition in the decision log (`analysis/decision_log.csv:796`; `artifacts/state.json:26`; `artifacts/state.json:29`; `artifacts/state.json:57`).

Next steps:
1. When Semantic Scholar access returns, rerun the archived query and append the responses (plus waiver details) so the release can link the refreshed literature coverage (`artifacts/state.json:29`).

Status: Completed the review-checklist and release preparations while deferring the Semantic Scholar replay; next priority is rerunning the blocked query once credentials are back up.
