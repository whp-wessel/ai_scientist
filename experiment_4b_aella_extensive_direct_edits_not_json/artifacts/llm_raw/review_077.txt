DECISION: CONTINUE – release-phase reproducibility/state artifacts remain tracked.

R1: PASS – Loop-077 auto-log (`analysis/decision_log.csv:843`) plus `artifacts/session_info.txt:1-7` anchor the seed/git head and link to the commands that refreshed the release package documented in `reports/findings_v2.2.md:1-6`.

L1: WARN – There is no `semantic_scholar_query_loop_077` entry nor a `lit/queries/loop_077/` directory, while the last captured literature record is loop_075’s CrossRef fallback (`lit/queries/loop_075/crossref_query_001.json`), so this loop lacks a new query log.

P1: PASS – `qc/disclosure_check_loop_076.md:1-18` (n≥10, `violations: 0`) together with `reports/findings_summary.md:2` prove the disclosure audit command/sample has been rerun and no small-cell leaks were released.

N1: PASS – `artifacts/state.json:1-36` still reports phase=release with every next action marked done, and `reports/findings_v2.2.md:7-12` spells out the archiving/hand-off steps, so the gate’s rationale remains justified.

Notes: Please capture the next Semantic Scholar attempt (or approved fallback) so the per-loop literature requirement stays explicit for future loops.
