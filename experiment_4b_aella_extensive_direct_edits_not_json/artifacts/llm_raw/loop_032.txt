**Key Updates**
- Logged the Loop 031 reviewer warning and reran the reproducibility checkpoint so R1 stays satisfied before any edits (analysis/decision_log.csv:306, artifacts/session_info.txt:1, qc/data_checks.md:46).
- Archived the mandated Loop 032 Semantic Scholar request (still HTTP 403) plus the paired CrossRef fallback JSON to keep the literature trail reproducible (lit/queries/loop_032/query_001.json:1, lit/queries/loop_032/crossref_query_002.json:1, analysis/decision_log.csv:308).
- Added Moran et al. 2018 to the evidence map and both bibliographies to bolster H2’s coping mediator narrative while the API outage persists (lit/evidence_map.csv:30, lit/bibliography.bib:334, lit/bibliography.json:585).
- Expanded the waiver memo, PAP blocker note, QC checklist, research notebook, and project state so they now cover loops 008–032 and reflect the new literature blocker (lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1, analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:57, qc/data_checks.md:53, notebooks/research_notebook.md:249, artifacts/state.json:25).
- PAP remains `status: draft`; confirmatory outputs stay paused until the Semantic Scholar key/waiver clears (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1).

**Next Steps**
- Secure a working Semantic Scholar credential or partner waiver, then freeze the PAP and unlock confirmatory analyses.
- Continue prepping maternal/paternal warmth + DERS transformations so mediator specifications are ready once the literature gate opens.

Loop 032 status (≤120 words): Logged the reviewer warning, refreshed session info/checksums, archived the required Semantic Scholar attempt, and added Moran et al. to all literature artifacts while extending the waiver memo and PAP/QC/state notes through loop 032. Priority remains unblocking the Semantic Scholar credential or waiver so the PAP can freeze and confirmatory work can start.
