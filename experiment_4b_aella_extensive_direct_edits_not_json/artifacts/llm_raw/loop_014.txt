**Key Updates**
- Logged the Loop 013 review expectations plus the mandatory Loop 014 Semantic Scholar query (still 403) in the decision log so the compliance trail shows both the plan and the new payload at `lit/queries/loop_014/query_001.json` (`analysis/decision_log.csv:98` and `analysis/decision_log.csv:99`).
- Added Pandya (2017) as a CrossRef-backed source for Claim C1, updating the evidence map and both bibliography formats to keep literature coverage reproducible despite the API outage (`lit/evidence_map.csv:6`, `lit/bibliography.bib:51`, `lit/bibliography.json:90`).
- Refreshed the PAP header/loop note to document the latest failure and fallback DOI while keeping status=`draft`, and extended the waiver memo so the attempt log now covers loops 008–014 with explicit DOI references (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1` & `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:19`; `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:5` & `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:17`).
- Updated QC, the research notebook, and experiment state so reproducibility checkpoints, narrative notes, and backlog data all reflect Loop 014 actions (`qc/data_checks.md:1`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:136`, `artifacts/state.json:3`, `artifacts/state.json:31`).

**Open Items**
- PAP cannot freeze until Semantic Scholar access is restored or the documented waiver is approved; this blocker is repeated in both the PAP and QC risk log (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:19`, `qc/data_checks.md:53`).
- Next action N1 remains “blocked” in state, awaiting a working key or waiver decision before analysis can proceed (`artifacts/state.json:31`).

Status: Logged review response, S2 attempt, new CrossRef DOI, and refreshed PAP/QC/notebook/state. Next priority: secure Semantic Scholar access or waiver approval so the PAP can freeze and confirmatory analyses may start.
