**Loop 033**
- Rechecked reproducibility and logged the reviewer response: session/env snapshot plus hashes refreshed (artifacts/session_info.txt:1, artifacts/checksums.json:1) with the QC checklist and decision log capturing the checkpoint and commitments (qc/data_checks.md:1, analysis/decision_log.csv:317).
- Mandatory Semantic Scholar query recorded alongside the CrossRef fallback (lit/queries/loop_033/query_001.json:1, lit/queries/loop_033/crossref_query_001.json:1), and the mentorship DOI now lives in the evidence map and bibliographies so H2 keeps progressing despite 403s (lit/evidence_map.csv:31, lit/bibliography.bib:347, lit/bibliography.json:606).
- Waiver memo extended through loop 033 with the new attempt log row and mentorship-support rationale (lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1,66) to maintain the literature-governance trail.
- PAP, notebook, and state all reflect the new blocker note and loop counter (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1,59; notebooks/research_notebook.md:255; artifacts/state.json:25), keeping phase=PAP with N1 blocked.

**Next Steps**
1. Secure Semantic Scholar access or a signed waiver so the PAP gate can finally freeze before analysis (artifacts/state.json:25; lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1).
2. Script/document mentorship/support variables to satisfy the new literature-driven modeling requirement ahead of PAP freeze (qc/data_checks.md:53).

Loop 033 status: Repro artifacts refreshed, mentorship DOI logged via CrossRef while Semantic Scholar remains 403, PAP stays draft awaiting waiver/API fix; priority is securing access so we can freeze and begin confirmatory work.
