- Reran the PAP/Rs pipeline with seed 20251016 (run_models → negative_control → summarize_results → calc_bh → build_results_summary) so `analysis/results.csv`, `tables/results_summary.*`, and the associated BH/NC artifacts now capture the confirmatory H1–H3 estimates, q-values, and the negative-control check, then executed the three sensitivity scripts and the disclosure scan to replenish those outputs plus `analysis/sensitivity_plan.md`.
- Logged the loop_059 Semantic Scholar 403 attempt, grabbed CrossRef metadata for DOI `10.1332/17579597y2024d000000035`, and pushed the DOI-backed entry into `lit/evidence_map.csv`/`lit/bibliography.*`, added the STROBE+SAMPL checklist and refreshed the measurement dossier so every hypothesis outcome/predictor has reliability/DIF notes, and updated the manuscript/outline/identification documents (both Markdown and LaTeX) along with the MANIFEST to cite the new tables, sensitivity work, and disclosure audit.
- Captured every step in `analysis/decision_log.csv`, added `analysis/results_pre_bh.csv`/`artifacts/measurement_validity_loop059.json`/new query archives, and set `artifacts/state.json` to loop 59 with N11/N12 still pending so the next loop can continue integration/QC while N8 remains focused on the literature waiver.

Status: Reran the confirmatory + sensitivity stack, refreshed the evidence map/bibliography, and rewrote the manuscript/outline/QC docs; next priority is to finish weaving these deterministic outputs into the writing suite (N11) while keeping the literature waiver (N8) and QC prep (N12) on track.
