Rebuilt the confirmatory outputs by aggregating the H1–H3/NC1 JSONs, running the BH correction, and emitting fresh tables so `analysis/results.csv:1-5` and `tables/results_summary.csv:1-4` now capture the seeded estimates+CIs+q-values for reporting (see `analysis/decision_log.csv:558-561`). Attempted loop_053’s Semantic Scholar search again; it returned 403, so the event is logged in `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:58`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:562`, and `artifacts/state.json:26-99` still keeps N8 pending as we wait for support. Drafted the sensitivity roadmap plus findings update—`analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:1-35` and `reports/findings_v1.0.md:6-26` now highlight pseudo-weight, design-effect, and pseudo-replicate scenarios, and `artifacts/state.json:91-95` marks N10 done with that plan documented.

1. Execute the pseudo-weight, design-effect grid, and pseudo-replicate scenarios in `analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:21-35`, tracking the commands/seeds and adding any derived tables/results.
2. Once the Semantic Scholar key works, replay the queued queries, append the responses to `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:58`, and update `artifacts/state.json:26-99`/`analysis/decision_log.csv:562` before closing N8.
3. Fold the confirmed and sensitivity narratives into `papers/main/imrad_outline.md` + `papers/main/manuscript.tex` per `reports/findings_v1.0.md:23-26` while keeping disclosure/waiver logs current.

Tests: not run (not requested).

Status: Reran the deterministic summary→BH→table pipeline, logged loop_053’s failed Semantic Scholar call while the waiver log/state stayed transparent, and drafted the sensitivity roadmap for pseudo-weight/design-effect/replicate checks; next priority is to run those scenarios before moving into the writing phase.
