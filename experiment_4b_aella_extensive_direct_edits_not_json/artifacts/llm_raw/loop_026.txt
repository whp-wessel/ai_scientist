**Updates**
- `analysis/decision_log.csv:242-251` now records the loop-26 reviewer sync, reproducibility checkpoint, Semantic Scholar failure, CrossRef fallback, literature/waiver additions, and the downstream PAP/QC/notebook/state edits so auditors can trace every move.
- Archived the required search artifacts despite the 403: `lit/queries/loop_026/query_001.json:1` (Semantic Scholar payload) and `lit/queries/loop_026/crossref_query_001.json:1` (CrossRef response).
- Added Talmon (2023) to the evidence stack (`lit/evidence_map.csv:24`, `lit/bibliography.bib:267`, `lit/bibliography.json:463`) and extended the waiver memo with the loop-26 attempt plus the new DOI (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1-58`), keeping the literature gate rationale explicit.
- PAP, QC, and narrative artifacts now carry the loop-26 blocker and reproducibility notes (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:45`, `qc/data_checks.md:1-55`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:210`), and `artifacts/state.json:25-33` reflects loop_counter=26 with N1 still blocked.
- Tests: not run (documentation-only loop).

**Next Steps**
1. Secure Semantic Scholar access (or formal waiver approval) and replay the queued searches to satisfy the PAP literature gate.
2. Implement the DERS plus maternal/paternal warmth coding so the PAP can freeze immediately once literature access is restored.

Status (Loop 26): Re-synced with reviewer guidance, reran the session/checksum QC, logged another 403 Semantic Scholar attempt with CrossRef fallback, and refreshed PAP/QC/notebook/state plus evidence/waiver artifacts. Next priority is restoring the Semantic Scholar credential (or waiver) so we can freeze the PAP right after scripting the DERS + warmth composites.
