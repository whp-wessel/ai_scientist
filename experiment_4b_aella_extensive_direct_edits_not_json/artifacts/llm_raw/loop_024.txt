**Loop 024 Work**
- Logged the reviewer sync, reproducibility checkpoint, query attempt, fallback sourcing, waiver refresh, and plan/QC/state updates so the audit trail stays contiguous (analysis/decision_log.csv:219 and analysis/decision_log.csv:228).
- Archived the required Semantic Scholar run (still HTTP 403) at `lit/queries/loop_024/query_001.json:1`, preserving endpoint, params, and error body for the waiver trail.
- Captured the matching CrossRef response (`lit/queries/loop_024/crossref_query_001.json:1`) and added Tung et al. 2023 to the evidence/bibliography stack so H2 covers parental incarceration→CVD links despite the outage (lit/evidence_map.csv:22; lit/bibliography.bib:246; lit/bibliography.json:420).
- Extended the waiver memo to Loop 024 with the new 403 row plus the JAMA Cardiology DOI (lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1 and lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:8-27,50).
- Kept the PAP in draft while flagging the new blocker, and refreshed QC, the research notebook, and project state so all governance files cite the latest evidence and loop counter (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:3 & 39; qc/data_checks.md:1 & 51-54; notebooks/research_notebook.md:197; artifacts/state.json:25-33).

**Next Steps**
1. Coordinate with ops on restoring the Semantic Scholar credential or securing approval for the documented waiver so PAP freeze criteria can be satisfied.
2. Once literature gate clears, finalize `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md` (status=frozen with registry URL/commit) and proceed toward confirmatory analyses.

Loop 024 status: Reviewer guidance, reproducibility, and privacy controls reconfirmed; Semantic Scholar remains 403 so a new parental-incarceration DOI plus waiver/plan/QC/state updates keep PAP in draft. Highest priority is still regaining API access or formal waiver approval so the PAP can freeze.
