**Summary**
- Logged the Loop 044 reviewer guidance in `analysis/decision_log.csv:452` and reran `runner.update_reproducibility()` so `artifacts/session_info.txt:1`, `artifacts/checksums.json:1`, and `artifacts/repro_report.md:1` capture the 22:31:38Z environment/seed snapshot before any edits.
- Archived the Loop 045 Semantic Scholar 403 payload (`lit/queries/loop_045/query_001.json:1`), captured the CrossRef fallback (`lit/queries/loop_045/crossref_query_002.json:1`), and propagated Mandelli et al. 2015 across `lit/evidence_map.csv:44`, `lit/bibliography.bib:492`, `lit/bibliography.json:852`, and the waiver log (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:48,57`) to keep H3 literature current despite the outage.
- Kept the PAP in `status: draft` by adding the Loop 045 blocker note plus the 2025‑11‑09/10 escalation commitments in `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:83`.
- Rolled the governance layer: `qc/data_checks.md:1` now reflects Loop 045 checkpoints and blocker text, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:336` records the narrative, and `artifacts/state.json:25` shows loop_counter = 45 with N1 still blocked but tied to the upcoming ops memo/support ticket.

**Testing**
- Not run (documentation and governance updates only).

**Next Steps**
1. Deliver the 2025‑11‑09 15:00Z ops memo (`lit/semantic_scholar_ops_memo_2025-11-09.md`) and capture transmission proof once the window opens.
2. Continue daily Semantic Scholar queries plus CrossRef fallbacks, and be ready to freeze the PAP as soon as the waiver/credential issue is resolved.

Status: Loop 045 refreshed reproducibility artifacts, logged another S2 403 with the Mandelli 2015 trauma meta-analysis fallback, and kept the PAP/QC/state artifacts aligned; next priority is executing the 2025-11-09 ops memo followed by the 2025-11-10 support ticket so the literature gate can finally clear.
