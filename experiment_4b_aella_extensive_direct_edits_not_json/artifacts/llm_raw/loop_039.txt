**Loop 39 Update**
- Re-synced with the reviewer directives and refreshed environment/hash snapshots so the reproducibility chain stays auditable (analysis/decision_log.csv:384, analysis/decision_log.csv:385, artifacts/session_info.txt:1, artifacts/checksums.json:1, artifacts/repro_report.md:1).
- Executed the mandated Semantic Scholar CLI call (still 403) and saved both the failed payload and CrossRef fallback plus the updated rate-limit ledger (lit/queries/loop_039/query_001.json:1, lit/queries/loop_039/crossref_query_001.json:1, analysis/decision_log.csv:386, analysis/decision_log.csv:387, artifacts/.s2_rate_limit.json:1).
- Logged Shlomi et al. (2022) across all literature registries to keep H2’s mobility-support moderator grounded in DOI-backed evidence (lit/evidence_map.csv:37, lit/bibliography.bib:421, lit/bibliography.json:734, analysis/decision_log.csv:388).
- Extended the waiver memo through Loop 039 so every 403 attempt and fallback source is traceable for ops review (lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1, lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:6, lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:42, lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:51, analysis/decision_log.csv:389).
- Kept the PAP in draft while documenting the new guidance×mobility requirement, rolled QC/notebook narratives, and updated the state tracker to loop_counter 39 with N1 still blocked (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1, analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:71, qc/data_checks.md:1, qc/data_checks.md:46, qc/data_checks.md:53, notebooks/research_notebook.md:294, artifacts/state.json:25, artifacts/state.json:28, analysis/decision_log.csv:390, analysis/decision_log.csv:391, analysis/decision_log.csv:392, analysis/decision_log.csv:393).
- Tests: not run (documentation/literature-only loop).

Next steps:
1. Secure the Semantic Scholar credential or documented waiver so backlog item N1 can clear and the PAP can freeze (artifacts/state.json:28).
2. Once the gate opens, script the guidance×mobility interaction/missing moderator transformations noted in the PAP (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:71).

Status: Loop 39 focused on reproducibility logging and literature upkeep while the Semantic Scholar outage persists. Next priority is clearing backlog item N1 by securing the new API key or waiver so the PAP can freeze.
