**Loop 17 Work**
- Logged the Loop 014 reviewer expectations, acknowledged the loop-016 abort, and rechecked session info/checksums so the decision log captures the recovery path before new work (`analysis/decision_log.csv:125-134`, `qc/data_checks.md:46-54`).
- Ran the mandated Semantic Scholar search (still 403 at `lit/queries/loop_017/query_001.json:1-18`) and archived two exploratory CrossRef scans plus the successful fallback payload (`lit/queries/loop_017/crossref_query_001.json:1`, `..._002.json:1`, `..._003.json:1`) for audit evidence.
- Added Loecher et al. (2023) to the evidence trail, tying the new DOI to Claim C2 in both the registry and bibliographies (`lit/evidence_map.csv:12`, `lit/bibliography.bib:123-134`, `lit/bibliography.json:211-230`).
- Extended the waiver memo/attempt log through loop 017 and refreshed the PAP draft note so freeze criteria remain explicit while the API key is blocked (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1-33`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-26`).
- Rolled the QC checklist, research notebook, and state file forward to keep the reproducibility trail aligned with the new literature status (`qc/data_checks.md:1-54`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:154-158`, `artifacts/state.json:31-38`).

**Next Steps**
- Continue pressing for Semantic Scholar credential restoration or a formal waiver approval so the PAP can freeze; rerun the queued S2 queries once access is back (`artifacts/state.json:31-38`).

Loop status (≤120 words): Reviewed the latest critique, acknowledged the prior abort, reran the required S2 query (still 403), logged CrossRef fallback evidence, and refreshed the PAP/QC/notebook/state artifacts. PAP remains draft until Semantic Scholar access is restored or the waiver is approved; next priority is clearing that literature gate.
