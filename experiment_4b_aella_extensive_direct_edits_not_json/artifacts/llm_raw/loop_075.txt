- Fulfilled the reviewer L1 warning by replaying the blocked query, capturing the CrossRef fallback under `lit/queries/loop_075/`, and adding the Conkbayir (2023) DOI to `lit/evidence_map.csv`, `lit/bibliography.bib`, `lit/bibliography.json`, and `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md`; the detailed trace sits in `analysis/decision_log.csv` for audit.
- Re-synced the release dossiers (`reports/findings_summary.md`, `reports/findings_v2.0.md`, `reports/review_checklist.md`) to cite the new fallback, reconfirm the `qc/disclosure_check_loop_074.md` guardrail, and recorded the refresh in `analysis/decision_log.csv`.
- Rebuilt the manuscript via `tectonic`, updated `papers/main/build_log.txt` with the clean pass, and bumped `artifacts/state.json` to loop 75, mark `N17` done, and add `N18` (“await reviewer confirmation”) so the release candidate is ready as soon as `review/research_findings.md` delivers a `DECISION: CONTINUE`.

Status: Added the Conkbayir crossref fallback plus waiver log updates, refreshed the release reports and build log, and queued `N18`; next priority is to monitor `review/research_findings.md` for a `DECISION: CONTINUE` before final release.
