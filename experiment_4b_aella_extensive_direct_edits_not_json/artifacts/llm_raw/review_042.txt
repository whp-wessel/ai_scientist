DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Session snapshot + dataset hashes regenerated before edits, and decision log captures every action for repeatability (artifacts/session_info.txt:1, artifacts/checksums.json:1, analysis/decision_log.csv:419).
L1: PASS – Semantic Scholar attempt logged with stored payload plus CrossRef fallback, and Kuhar et al. DOI propagated to evidence map + bibliography (lit/queries/loop_042/query_001.json:1, lit/evidence_map.csv:41, lit/bibliography.bib:457).
P1: PASS – No public outputs released; QC log reiterates disclosure guard with latest small-cell check reference (qc/data_checks.md:52).
N1: PASS – PAP remains clearly marked draft while next_actions document the blocked S2 issue together with dated ops memo/support-ticket plan (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1, artifacts/state.json:24, lit/semantic_scholar_ops_memo_2025-11-09.md:1, lit/semantic_scholar_support_ticket_draft_2025-11-10.md:1).
Notes: Ensure the ops memo/support ticket are actually dispatched on the stated deadlines so the PAP gate can unblock once responses arrive.
