**Key Updates**
- Kept the PAP in draft, refreshed its timestamp, and added a Loop 50 blocker note tying the 403 query and Arslan resilience evidence to the pending S2 ops memo/support ticket (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1, analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:93).
- Rolled `qc/data_checks.md` to Loop 50, documenting the new 11:46Z reproducibility checkpoint and the expanded Semantic Scholar risk narrative to satisfy the reviewer’s header fix (qc/data_checks.md:1, qc/data_checks.md:46, qc/data_checks.md:50).
- Archived the mandated Semantic Scholar attempt plus CrossRef response and propagated Arslan 2015 across the evidence map, both bibliographies, and the waiver log so H3 keeps DOI-backed coverage during the outage (lit/queries/loop_050/query_001.json:1, lit/queries/loop_050/crossref_query_001.json:1, lit/evidence_map.csv:49, lit/bibliography.bib:553, lit/bibliography.json:950, lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1, lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:89, lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:110).
- Logged the full Loop 50 narrative (review sync, repro checkpoint, literature work, governance updates) in the running notebook for traceability (notebooks/research_notebook.md:371).
- Updated `artifacts/state.json` so loop_counter=50 and next action N1 explicitly references the Loop 50 403 payload plus upcoming ops/ticket milestones (artifacts/state.json:25, artifacts/state.json:30).

**Next Steps**
1. Execute the 2025‑11‑09 Semantic Scholar ops memo followed by the 2025‑11‑10 support ticket to unlock API access or secure a waiver so the PAP can freeze.
2. Finalize resilience/self-concept transformation scripts and DIF checks so confirmatory specifications are ready once the literature gate clears.

Loop 50 status: Reviewed Loop 49 critique, refreshed reproducibility artifacts, reran the mandatory Semantic Scholar query (still 403) and captured Arslan 2015 as a CrossRef fallback while keeping PAP/QC/state artifacts current. Next priority is executing the pending Semantic Scholar ops memo/support ticket and drafting the resilience/self-concept coding so the PAP can freeze when the literature gate clears.
