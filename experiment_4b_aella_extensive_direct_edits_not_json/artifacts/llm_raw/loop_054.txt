Summary:
- Rebuilt the confirmatory pipeline by re-running `analysis/code/summarize_results.py` → `analysis/results_pre_bh.csv:1`, `analysis/code/calc_bh.py` → `analysis/results.csv:1`, and `analysis/code/build_results_summary.py` → `tables/results_summary.csv:1`/`tables/results_summary.md:1` so the BH q-values, effect sizes, and CI remarks stay synchronized with the JSON outputs.
- Extended `analysis/code/run_models.py:255-360` with `extract_weights` and optional weighting so the new scripts at `analysis/code/pseudo_weight_sensitivity.py:1`, `analysis/code/design_effect_grid.py:1`, and `analysis/code/pseudo_replicates.py:1` can simulate pseudo weights/design effects/jackknife replicates; their results live in `outputs/sensitivity_pseudo_weights/`, `outputs/sensitivity_design_effect_grid.*`, and `outputs/sensitivity_replicates/sensitivity_replicates_summary.json`, all captured in `analysis/sensitivity_manifest.md:1-24`.
- Documented the executed scenarios and next steps in `analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:32-40`, highlighted them in the findings log and notebook (`reports/findings_v1.0.md:7-27`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:386-390`), and logged the review follow-up plus each script/run/disclosure action in `analysis/decision_log.csv:567-580`.
- Reinforced governance by rerunning `qc/disclosure_check_loop_054.md:1-18`, appending the Loop 054 outage row in `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:147-152`, saving the latest 403 payload at `lit/queries/loop_054/query_001.json:1`, and advancing `artifacts/state.json:25-50` to the sensitivity phase with new next actions aligned to manuscript updates and STROBE/SAMPL prep.

Testing:
- Command runs recorded in `analysis/decision_log.csv:567-575` cover `analysis/code/summarize_results.py`, `analysis/code/calc_bh.py`, `analysis/code/build_results_summary.py`, `analysis/code/pseudo_weight_sensitivity.py`, `analysis/code/design_effect_grid.py`, `analysis/code/pseudo_replicates.py`, and `analysis/code/disclosure_check.py`; no additional automated tests were introduced.

Next steps:
- Follow `artifacts/state.json:35-47` by integrating the confirmatory/sensitivity outputs plus `qc/disclosure_check_loop_054.md` into the manuscript/outline/identification files and refreshing the STROBE/SAMPL checklist before entering the writing phase.
- Continue logging Semantic Scholar retries (per `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:147-152`) until the API recovers so the waiver backlog (N8) can close and any new DOI-backed responses feed into `analysis/decision_log.csv`.

Status: Re-ran the confirmatory/BH/table pipeline, executed the three sensitivity scenarios plus the disclosure check, updated all narrative logs, and recorded the latest 403 Semantic Scholar attempt; next priority is to fold these outputs into the manuscript/outline while keeping the waiver log/current disclosure/audit trail aligned (N11/N12).
