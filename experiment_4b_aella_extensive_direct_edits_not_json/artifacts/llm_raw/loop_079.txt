Acknowledged the loop-078 review summary and logged a response that records R1/L1/P1/N1 as passed while noting the ongoing plan to keep tracking the next Semantic Scholar query or CrossRef fallback; see `analysis/decision_log.csv:849`.

Status: Loop work consisted solely of updating the decision log with the reviewer response; next priority is to continue capturing the “next Semantic Scholar recovery” (or sanctioned fallback) so future loops can resume direct API coverage when the service is available.
