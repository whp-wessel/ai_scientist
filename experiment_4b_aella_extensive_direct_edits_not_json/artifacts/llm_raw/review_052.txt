- Logged the Loop 052 review entry in `review/research_findings.md` with PASS ratings for R1/L1/P1/N1 and notes on the pending API/key and sensitivity memo tasks.
- Work remains in the analysis phase while the Semantic Scholar credential outage (N8) and the planned sensitivity memo (N10) stay open per `artifacts/state.json`.

Next steps:
1. Resume the queued Semantic Scholar queries once the key is restored and update the evidence map/bibliography with any new DOIs.
2. Draft the sensitivity memo that synthesizes the robustness outputs before advancing to the next phase.
