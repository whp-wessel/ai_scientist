Loop 067 reran the seeded sensitivity suite so the plan, manifest, and documentation keep pace with the new pseudo-weight/design-effect/pseudo-replicate outputs while leaving the writing-phase QC gate (N14) as the next milestone.

- Pseudo-weight, DEFF-grid, and jackknife commands now write to `outputs/sensitivity_pseudo_weights_loop067/`, `outputs/sensitivity_design_effect_grid_loop067.*`, and `outputs/sensitivity_replicates_loop067/`, and those scenarios are described in `analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:1` and catalogued in `analysis/sensitivity_manifest.md:1`.
- The decision log registers the R1/L1/P1/N1 response and the loop-067 reruns plus doc/state updates (`analysis/decision_log.csv:752`), the findings summary/logs were refreshed for loop 067 (`reports/findings_summary.md:1`, `reports/findings_v1.5.md:1`), the notebook now records the new section (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:424`), and `artifacts/state.json:25` increments the loop counter to 67 while keeping writing-phase QC pending.
- Reproducibility artifacts reflect the latest run (`artifacts/session_info.txt:1`, `artifacts/repro_report.md:1`) so timestamps and git heads match the loop-067 commands.
- Tests: executed the seeded scenario suite via `analysis/code/pseudo_weight_sensitivity.py` (`analysis/decision_log.csv:753`), `analysis/code/design_effect_grid.py` (`analysis/decision_log.csv:754`), and `analysis/code/pseudo_replicates.py` (`analysis/decision_log.csv:755`), producing the new outputs above.

Next steps:
1. Complete the writing-phase QC pass (manuscript/outline sync, STROBE+SAMPL checklist, DAG/identification memo, LaTeX rebuild with log entry) so we can advance toward review.
2. Continue logging Semantic Scholar (or CrossRef fallback) queries for every `[CLAIM:<ID>]` and mirror the metadata in `lit/evidence_map.csv` + bibliography artifacts before moving past the literature gate.
