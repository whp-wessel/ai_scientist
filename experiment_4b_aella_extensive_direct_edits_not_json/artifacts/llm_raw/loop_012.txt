**Loop 12 Updates**
- `analysis/decision_log.csv:84-88` now captures this loop’s reviewer sync, the loop_012 Semantic Scholar retry, the CrossRef fallback addition, the PAP/QC refresh, and the new waiver-tracking action so reviewers can trace every move.
- `lit/queries/loop_012/query_001.json` + `lit/queries/loop_012/crossref_query_001.json` preserve the 403 payload and the Ross et al. (2019) metadata that underpin today’s literature progress despite the API outage.
- `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:15` and `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:99` document the Loop‑12 evidence addition and add a sixth PAP gate tying freeze permission to completion of the waiver package.
- `artifacts/state.json:30-71` keeps phase=`pap`, loop_counter=12, and adds next action **N6** so the Semantic Scholar waiver deliverable is formally tracked (owner=agent, status=in_progress).
- `notebooks/research_notebook.md:73-76` folds the waiver plan into the “Next Steps” narrative and notes that confirmatory work remains paused until the key or waiver lands.

Tests: not run (documentation-only loop).

Loop status (≤120 words): Logged Loop 11 reviewer responses, reran the required Semantic Scholar query (still 403) with a CrossRef fallback, refreshed PAP/QC/notebook narratives, and added N6 to track the waiver packet. Next priority is assembling that waiver dossier (loops 008–012 query evidence plus Ross 2019) while continuing the per-loop S2 attempts.
