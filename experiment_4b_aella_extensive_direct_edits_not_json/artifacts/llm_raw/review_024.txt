DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – qc/data_checks.md:3 and qc/data_checks.md:47 document Loop 024 seed 20251016 plus current session/checksum checkpoints, analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:44 lists the deterministic scripts, and analysis/decision_log.csv:220 records the reproducibility action so the audit trail stays intact.
L1: PASS – analysis/decision_log.csv:221 shows the mandated Semantic Scholar call, the 403 payload is stored at lit/queries/loop_024/query_001.json:1, the CrossRef fallback at lit/queries/loop_024/crossref_query_001.json:1, and the Tung et al. DOI is propagated to lit/evidence_map.csv:22 and lit/bibliography.bib:254.
P1: PASS – The n≥10 disclosure guard is reiterated in analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:45 and qc/disclosure_check_loop_006.md:6, while qc/data_checks.md:53 confirms no public tables this loop, so privacy controls remain satisfied.
N1: PASS – artifacts/state.json:25 and artifacts/state.json:70 keep loop_counter=24 with phase=pap, artifacts/state.json:30 and artifacts/state.json:32 show N1 still blocked by the 403 issue, analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:39 echoes the blocker, and lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1 documents the loop 008–024 waiver log, justifying holding the phase.
