**Loop 036 Summary**
- Reproducibility: refreshed the environment snapshot, dataset hashes, and repro log so reviewer R1 evidence stays current (`artifacts/session_info.txt:1-9`, `artifacts/checksums.json:1-14`, `qc/data_checks.md:1-54`, `artifacts/repro_report.md:1-11`). The mandated Semantic Scholar CLI call also advanced the rate-limit ledger (`artifacts/.s2_rate_limit.json:1-3`).
- Literature attempt: recorded the required Semantic Scholar search and 403 payload plus the CrossRef fallback JSON (`lit/queries/loop_036/query_001.json:1-18`, `lit/queries/loop_036/crossref_query_004.json:1`). Decision-log rows and the waiver memo now cover loops 008–036 with the new query/DOI trail (`analysis/decision_log.csv:351-360`, `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1-40`).
- Evidence map & bibliography: added Hintikka et al. (1998) to the registry and bibliography while fixing the Gasper/Renjilian quoting so the CSV parses cleanly (`lit/evidence_map.csv:15-33`, `lit/bibliography.bib:359-369`, `lit/bibliography.json:628-646`).
- Governance: PAP stays draft but now cites the Loop 036 religiosity blocker, the loop notebook documents the actions, and state.json tracks loop_counter=36 with N1 still blocked (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-65`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:273-279`, `artifacts/state.json:25-33`, `qc/data_checks.md:1-54`).
- Tests: not run (documentation and literature-governance updates only).

**Next**
1. Finish the Semantic Scholar waiver/credential fix so PAP can freeze and confirmatory work may start.
2. While blocked, script the mediator/mentorship transformations flagged by the new literature so robustness specs are ready.

Loop status (≤120 words): Kept phase=PAP after logging Loop 036’s reproducibility refresh, Semantic Scholar 403 payload, CrossRef fallback, and governance updates; PAP remains draft pending the S2 waiver/credential fix. Priority is still clearing N1 so the PAP can freeze and analysis can begin.
