**Key Updates**
- Logged the Loop 037 reviewer guidance plus action plan (`analysis/decision_log.csv:373`) and refreshed reproducibility artifacts so R1 stays green: the new environment snapshot sits in `artifacts/session_info.txt:1` and the re-hashed raw/imputed fingerprints in `artifacts/checksums.json:2`, both referenced before any subsequent edits (`analysis/decision_log.csv:374`).
- Mandatory Semantic Scholar search still returned HTTP 403, so the error payload lives at `lit/queries/loop_038/query_001.json:1` with a CrossRef fallback in `lit/queries/loop_038/crossref_query_001.json:1` (`analysis/decision_log.csv:375`/`376`). Musliner & Singer 2014 was added to the evidence map (`lit/evidence_map.csv:36`), BibTeX (`lit/bibliography.bib:408`), and JSON bibliography (`lit/bibliography.json:714`), and the waiver log now carries the loop 038 attempt plus interpretation (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:41`,`49`; `analysis/decision_log.csv:377`,`378`).
- Governance artifacts remain in PAP phase: `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:3`/`69` documents the updated timestamp and Loop 038 blocker note, `qc/data_checks.md:1` rolls the checklist with the new reproducibility checkpoint, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:287` captures the loop narrative, and `artifacts/state.json:25` reflects `loop_counter=38`, phase `pap`, and N1 still blocked (logged at `analysis/decision_log.csv:379`–`382`). No confirmatory outputs were produced while status stays draft.

**Next Steps**
1. Pursue the Semantic Scholar credential fix or waiver so the PAP can freeze and unlock confirmatory work.
2. Continue scripting/documenting mediator transformations (warmth, adult-support moderators) so they are ready once literature governance clears.

Status: Reproducibility, literature logging, and governance files are current for loop 038 while the Semantic Scholar outage keeps the PAP in draft; priority remains securing the credential/waiver so confirmatory analysis can start.
