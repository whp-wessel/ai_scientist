**Loop 49**
- Logged reviewer responses plus every action in `analysis/decision_log.csv:497-506`, keeping the audit trail current before touching artifacts.
- Maintained PAP as draft while adding the new Semantic Scholar blocker note and timestamp (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-3,91`), so confirmatory work stays gated until the outage clears.
- Captured the latest 403 payload and CrossRef fallback (`lit/queries/loop_049/query_001.json:1`, `lit/queries/loop_049/crossref_query_002.json:1`), then mapped the mentor DOI through the evidence and bibliography stack (`lit/evidence_map.csv:48`, `lit/bibliography.bib:540`, `lit/bibliography.json:931`).
- Resolved the reviewer’s WARN by extending the waiver header, attempt log, and source bullets to loop 049 (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1-11,80`), explicitly showing the Glenn + Journal of Adolescent Health coverage.
- Re-ran the reproducibility checkpoint and refreshed QC + documentation artifacts (`qc/data_checks.md:46-53`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:364`, `artifacts/state.json:25-33`) so logs, notebook narrative, and phase metadata reflect the new blocker state.

Loop49 status (≤120 words): Repro snapshot refreshed, Semantic Scholar query logged (still 403), fallback mentor DOI distributed across evidence/bibliography/waiver, and PAP+QC+state files updated while keeping disclosure outputs untouched. Next priority is to dispatch the 9 Nov ops memo, rerun the mandated query for loop 50, and freeze the PAP once the credential or waiver gate is cleared.
