Loop counter is now 61 and the phase stays `sensitivity` per `artifacts/state.json:1`, so the gate to writing/review remains held while we finish integrating these reruns and QC updates.

**Summary**
- Re-aggregated the H1–H3 JSON outputs into `analysis/results_pre_bh.csv:1`, applied BH (`analysis/results.csv:1` + `artifacts/bh_summary.json`), regenerated `tables/results_summary.csv:1`/`.md`, and documented the review response that ties R1–N1 to this rerun in `analysis/decision_log.csv:680`.
- Testing/sensitivity coverage: reran pseudo weights (e.g., `outputs/sensitivity_pseudo_weights/pseudo_weights_deff_100.json:1`), rebuilt the design-effect grid (`outputs/sensitivity_design_effect_grid.csv:1`), generated pseudo-replicate summaries (`outputs/sensitivity_replicates/sensitivity_replicates_summary.json:1`), and rechecked disclosure (`qc/disclosure_check_loop_061.md:1` with violations=0) so every publication-ready asset uses seeded commands.
- Captured the blocked Semantic Scholar query (`lit/queries/loop_061/query_001.json:1`), logged the CrossRef fallback for DOI `10.23880/mhrij-16000182` (`lit/queries/loop_061/crossref_query_001.json:1`), and added the new evidence entry (`lit/evidence_map.csv:55`, `lit/bibliography.bib:591`, `lit/bibliography.json:1009`); the sensitivity plan (`analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:1`), findings summary (`reports/findings_summary.md:1`), and notebook (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:392`) now describe these reruns plus the literature fallback.

**Next Steps**
1. Integrate the refreshed confirmatory outputs, tables, and sensitivity artifacts (plus `qc/disclosure_check_loop_061.md`) into the manuscript/outline/reporting stack (`papers/main/manuscript.tex`, `papers/main/imrad_outline.md`, `reports/identification.md`) so every `[CLAIM:<ID>]` references deterministic assets.
2. Refresh the QC dossiers (`qc/strobe_sampl_checklist.md`, `qc/measures_validity.md`, etc.) to reflect the new results/sensitivity suite before moving past the sensitivity phase.
3. Keep logging each blocked Semantic Scholar query and its CrossRef fallback (see `lit/queries/loop_061/...`) until access is restored so the evidence map/bibliography remain DOI-backed.
