**Loop 46 Highlights**
- Logged the Loop045 reviewer directives and response plan before editing, then refreshed the reproducibility bundle; `analysis/decision_log.csv:463` captures the review sync, while `artifacts/session_info.txt:1`, `artifacts/repro_report.md:1`, and `qc/data_checks.md:1` show the new checkpoint plus reiterated disclosure guard.
- Recorded the required Semantic Scholar attempt (`lit/queries/loop_046/query_001.json:1`) and, after another 403, captured the Zhang (2025) positive-childhood-experience meta-analysis via CrossRef (`lit/queries/loop_046/crossref_query_002.json:1`). The DOI now lives in `lit/evidence_map.csv:45`, `lit/bibliography.bib:505`, and `lit/bibliography.json:873` so H2’s mentorship/guidance literature stays current.
- Extended the waiver memo to cover Loop 046 and highlighted the new fallback evidence plus escalation timeline (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1` & `49-58`). The PAP header now reflects the latest timestamp and adds a Loop 046 blocker note tying the PCE meta-analysis to required measurements (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-5,85`).
- Documented the loop narrative and backlog in `notebooks/research_notebook.md:343` and kept the project in phase `pap` with loop_counter=46 and N1 flagged as blocked with the ops memo/support-ticket schedule (`artifacts/state.json:25-33`).
- Unrelated files under `../experiment_4a_aella_minimal_direct_edits_not_json/` remain modified (e.g., `artifacts/last_commit.txt:1`); they were untouched this loop.

**Next Steps**
1. Execute the 2025-11-09 ops memo and, if needed, file the 2025-11-10 Semantic Scholar support ticket to unblock literature access.
2. Continue documenting positive childhood experience / mentorship proxies (e.g., guidance scales, trusted adult indicators) so the PAP can freeze immediately once the literature gate clears.

Loop 046 status: Refreshed reproducibility artifacts, logged another 403 Semantic Scholar attempt with the Zhang (2025) meta-analysis fallback, expanded the waiver + PAP notes, and kept the project in PAP phase. Next priority is delivering the scheduled ops memo/support ticket and tightening the measurement notes for positive-support variables so the PAP can freeze when the literature gate opens.
