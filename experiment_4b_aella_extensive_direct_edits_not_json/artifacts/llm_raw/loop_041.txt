**Updates**
- Repro checkpoint refreshed via the runner utilities before any planning edits, capturing the current environment snapshot and dataset hashes for reviewer R1 (artifacts/session_info.txt:1; artifacts/checksums.json:1).
- Logged the loop-mandated Semantic Scholar search plus 403 payload and paired CrossRef response, then integrated Ashton et al. (2021) across the evidence map and bibliographies to keep H2 mentorship coverage current (lit/queries/loop_041/query_001.json:1; lit/queries/loop_041/crossref_query_001.json:1; lit/evidence_map.csv:40; lit/bibliography.bib:444; lit/bibliography.json:773).
- Extended the waiver memo through Loop 041 so auditors can see the enlarged failure count, new table row, and fallback summary alongside the escalation plan (lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1; lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:6; lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:44; lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:54).
- PAP, QC, and state artifacts remain draft but now include the Loop 041 note plus explicit mention that loops 008–041 are blocked pending the scheduled ops memo and support ticket (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1; analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:75; analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:154; qc/data_checks.md:1; qc/data_checks.md:53; artifacts/state.json:25; artifacts/state.json:30).
- The research notebook records this loop’s narrative (review sync → repro checkpoint → query/fallback → governance updates) to keep the running audit trail intact (notebooks/research_notebook.md:308).

**Next Steps**
1. Draft and send the 2025-11-09 ops escalation memo summarizing loops 008–041 403 logs plus fallback citations.
2. If no credential fix arrives, finalize the 2025-11-10 Semantic Scholar support-ticket package while continuing daily CLI queries and CrossRef fallbacks.
3. Continue pre-freeze prep (measurement/disclosure automation hooks) so the PAP can freeze immediately once the literature gate clears.

Loop 041 status: Repro checkpoint logged, S2 outage still blocking PAP freeze, Ashton trusted-adult DOI captured via CrossRef, governance artifacts refreshed. Next priority is executing the 2025-11-09 ops memo and prepping the 2025-11-10 S2 ticket while continuing daily query attempts.
