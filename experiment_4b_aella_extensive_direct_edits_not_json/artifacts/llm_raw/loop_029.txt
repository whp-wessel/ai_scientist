**Loop 029 Deliverables**
- R1 reproducibility stayed current: regenerated the environment snapshot plus git/pip metadata and re-confirmed dataset hashes before any edits (`artifacts/session_info.txt:1-11`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:273-274`), with the checkpoint recorded in the QC log (`qc/data_checks.md:1-55`).
- Literature diligence: archived the required Semantic Scholar attempt (still HTTP 403; `lit/queries/loop_029/query_001.json:1-18`), captured the CrossRef fallback (`lit/queries/loop_029/crossref_query_001.json`), and registered Gerra et al. 2016 across the evidence map and bibliographies (`lit/evidence_map.csv:27`, `lit/bibliography.bib:302-311`, `lit/bibliography.json:521-543`). The waiver memo now shows ≥22 logged failures plus the new mechanism (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1-60`).
- PAP & QC remain draft while incorporating the cortisol/nicotine guardrails: Loop 029 note now highlights those covariates (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:51`), and the QC checklist cites the refreshed session snapshot plus blocker trail (`qc/data_checks.md:46-55`).
- Narrative/state syncing: the research notebook and state file document loop_counter = 29, phase = PAP, and N1 blocked pending S2 restoration, tying the blocker to the new DOI (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:231-235`, `artifacts/state.json:25-33`).
- Traceability: Decision Log rows capture the review sync, repro check, query/fallback, waiver update, PAP/QC refresh, notebook entry, and state change for auditors (`analysis/decision_log.csv:273-282`).

Tests: not run (PAP-phase documentation updates only).

1. Obtain the Semantic Scholar credential or a formal waiver so the PAP can meet its gate, then replay queued S2 queries.
2. Script the cortisol/nicotine stress proxies plus DERS/maternal–paternal warmth composites so PAP estimands point to ready code once the gate opens.
3. Prepare registry URL/freeze_commit details to freeze the PAP immediately after literature compliance is satisfied.

Status (≤120 words): Loop 29 logged the reviewer response, refreshed reproducibility artifacts, documented the still-failing Semantic Scholar query, and added the Gerra et al. cortisol/nicotine DOI across the evidence map, bibliographies, waiver memo, PAP, QC, notebook, and state. We remain in PAP phase until Semantic Scholar access (or a waiver) is granted; next priority is securing that approval and finishing the cortisol/DERS coding hooks so the PAP can freeze as soon as the literature gate clears.
