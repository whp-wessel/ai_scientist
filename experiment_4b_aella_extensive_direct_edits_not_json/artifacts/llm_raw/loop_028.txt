**Key Updates**
- Logged the Loop 027 reviewer directives plus the Loop 028 reproducibility checkpoint in `analysis/decision_log.csv:264-271`, and refreshed the environment snapshot at `artifacts/session_info.txt:1` so R1 traceability stays intact despite the ongoing PAP hold.
- Ran the mandated Semantic Scholar search (still 403) and archived the payload at `lit/queries/loop_028/query_001.json:1`; paired CrossRef fallbacks (`lit/queries/loop_028/crossref_query_00{1,2}.json:1`) enabled us to add Nelson 1982 to the evidence base and bibliographies (`lit/evidence_map.csv:26`, `lit/bibliography.bib:289`, `lit/bibliography.json:512`) while extending the waiver log through Loop 028 (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1-35`).
- Updated the PAP header and blocker notes with the new adversity requirements (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-49`), captured the narrative in `notebooks/research_notebook.md:224-228`, and rolled `artifacts/state.json:25-33` forward (loop_counter = 28, phase = PAP, N1 still blocked).

**Next Steps**
1. Secure Semantic Scholar credential or formal waiver approval, then rerun the queued S2 queries so the PAP can freeze.
2. Start scripting the adversity-loss covariates flagged by the Nelson replication so the PAP can reference concrete transformations once the literature gate clears.

Loop status (≤120 words): Loop 028 focused on maintaining the PAP gate—review directives were logged, reproducibility artifacts refreshed, the S2 outage documented, and a new CrossRef-backed parental-loss study wired into the evidence/waiver files while the PAP, notebook, and state now reference the expanded adversity plan. Priority remains clearing the Semantic Scholar credential or waiver so the PAP can freeze.
