DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Loop 038 log plus QC record the review sync and repro checkpoint, and session_info captures seed/git HEAD for this loop (analysis/decision_log.csv:373-374; qc/data_checks.md:46-49; artifacts/session_info.txt:1-9).
L1: PASS – Mandated S2 query + 403 payload and the CrossRef fallback were saved, and the Musliner DOI is reflected in the evidence map, bibliography, and waiver ledger (lit/queries/loop_038/query_001.json:1; lit/queries/loop_038/crossref_query_001.json:1; lit/evidence_map.csv:36; lit/bibliography.bib:408; lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:41-49).
P1: PASS – No new public tables/figures were issued and the QC file reiterates sensitive-column safeguards and disclosure log coverage (qc/data_checks.md:50-56).
N1: PASS – State remains in PAP with N1 explicitly blocked and stop_now=false, while the PAP stays status=draft with the Loop 038 blocker noted (artifacts/state.json:25-74; analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-69).

Notes: Continue pushing on the Semantic Scholar credential/waiver so the PAP gate can close.
