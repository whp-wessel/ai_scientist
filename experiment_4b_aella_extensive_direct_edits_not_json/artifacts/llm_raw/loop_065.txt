**Loop 065**
- Reran the seeded pseudo-weight (DEFF=1.0/1.25/1.5), design-effect (through DEFF=2.0), and pseudo-replicate (k=6) scenarios so the uncertainty narrative in `analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:1` now matches the refreshed outputs ahead of writing-phase QC.
- Logged the Loop 065 review response at `analysis/decision_log.csv:732` and the three scenario reruns at `analysis/decision_log.csv:733`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:734`, and `analysis/decision_log.csv:735`, refreshed the public-facing summary in `reports/findings_summary.md:1`, created `reports/findings_v1.3.md:1`, and captured the new notebook note starting at `notebooks/research_notebook.md:414`.
- Advanced `artifacts/state.json:3` to loop 65 while keeping the sensitivity phase active and refreshed the reproducibility snapshots in `artifacts/session_info.txt:1` and `artifacts/repro_report.md:1`.

Loop status: Completed Loop 065 sensitivity reruns and documentation updates; next priority is the writing-phase QC (manuscript/Markdown parity, outline refresh, STROBE/SAMPL checklist, DAG verification, and LaTeX rebuild) before transitioning to the review gate.
