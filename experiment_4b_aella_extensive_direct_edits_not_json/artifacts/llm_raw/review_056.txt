DECISION: STOP – missing loop_056 disclosure audit  
R1: PASS – session_info.txt records seed 20251016 and decision_log.csv:598-608 documents each deterministic rerun (pseudo_weight_sensitivity through apply_bh) referencing config/agent_config.yaml.  
L1: WARN – loop 056 logged no new Semantic Scholar query; the last stored response remains lit/queries/loop_055/query_001.json, so fresh literature coverage is outstanding.  
P1: FAIL – qc/disclosure_check_loop_056.md is absent from qc/, leaving the new confirmatory/sensitivity tables without the required small-cell/suppression audit (violations count cannot be confirmed).  
N1: WARN – artifacts/state.json still points N11 toward qc/disclosure_check_loop_055.md instead of the loop_056 disclosure, so gating info for advancing past the sensitivity phase is stale.  
Notes: Please author qc/disclosure_check_loop_056.md (violations: 0) and rerun the literature query logging when a new Semantic Scholar search occurs before resuming.
