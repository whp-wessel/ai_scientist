## Loop 067 — 2025-11-09T19:20:00.000000+00:00
DECISION: STOP – Loop 067 lacks documented Semantic Scholar query
R1: PASS – The plan records seed 20251016 (analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:3) and decision log entry 753 ties the pseudo-weight rerun to deterministic outputs, keeping the scenario reruns reproducible.
L1: FAIL – The literature log stops at loop 064 (analysis/decision_log.csv:723); loop-067 entries (analysis/decision_log.csv:753) cover only sensitivity reruns and no `lit/queries/loop_067` directory exists, so the required query was never archived.
P1: PASS – The plan notes no new tables/figures and reuses the latest disclosure audit (qc/disclosure_check_loop_064.md:1, violations=0) to keep n≥10 protections in place.
N1: PASS – artifacts/state.json:26 lists the next actions and artifacts/state.json:56 keeps writing-phase QC (N14) pending, matching the planned gate before advancing.
Notes: Please run/log the missing Semantic Scholar query (and CrossRef fallback if needed) for loops 065–067 before proceeding so the literature map stays compliant.
