- **Summary** Updated `papers/main/manuscript.tex:14`/`17` so the abstract now points to `qc/disclosure_check_loop_069.md:1` and the introduction adds the Poole et al. (2017) resilience cite while keeping the `[CLAIM:C1]` narrative aligned; the loop-069 story now lives in the refreshed findings summary (`reports/findings_summary.md:1`) and the new versioned log (`reports/findings_v1.7.md:1`), and the notebook records the same.
- **Evidence** Documented the CrossRef fallback (`lit/evidence_map.csv:59`) plus payload `lit/queries/loop_069/crossref_query_002.json:1` to keep Claim C1 DOI-backed while Semantic Scholar stays 403, ensuring the literature map and bibliography mirror the resilience-protective mechanism.
- **State** Advanced the workflow to the review phase (`artifacts/state.json:57`), logged N13/N14 as done, added N15 for review-phase prep, and bumped `loop_counter`/last-abort tracking so the next milestone is a review-checklist response.
- **Testing** `tectonic --keep-logs papers/main/manuscript.tex` (PASS with overfull warnings but reproducible PDF) and `python analysis/code/disclosure_check.py --tables-dir tables --figures-dir figures --output-md qc/disclosure_check_loop_069.md --seed 20251016` (PASS, n≥10 audit).

- **Next steps**
  1. Draft `reports/review_checklist.md`, respond to the latest `review/research_findings.md` entry, and capture that resolution in `analysis/decision_log.csv` so the review gate can move forward.
  2. Keep cataloguing Semantic Scholar/CrossRef fallbacks (loop 070+) so every `[CLAIM:<ID>]` retains at least one DOI-backed source before any release.

Status: Finished the writing-phase QC, resilience literature refresh, and LaTeX rebuild while recording the new disclosure audit and review-phase kickoff; Next priority: populate the review checklist and respond to the reviewer log before advancing the release cycle.
