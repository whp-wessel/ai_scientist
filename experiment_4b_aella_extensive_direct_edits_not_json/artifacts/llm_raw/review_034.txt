DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Repro checkpoint recorded in `analysis/decision_log.csv:329`, the environment/seed snapshot was regenerated in `artifacts/session_info.txt:1` with hashes rechecked in `artifacts/checksums.json:1`, and the QC log highlights those artifacts at `qc/data_checks.md:46`, so determinism stays auditable.
L1: PASS – The loop logged the mandated Semantic Scholar attempt (403) in `analysis/decision_log.csv:330` with the payload saved under `lit/queries/loop_034/query_001.json:1`, mapped the Gasper mentoring DOI into `lit/evidence_map.csv:32` and `lit/bibliography.bib:366`, and updated the outage/waiver ledger covering loops 008–034 in `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1` and `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:37`.
P1: PASS – Disclosure guardrails remain n≥10 with the last automated audit documenting zero violations in `qc/disclosure_check_loop_006.md:6` and `qc/disclosure_check_loop_006.md:17`, and `qc/data_checks.md:52` confirms no new tables/figures were released this loop, so privacy risk is unchanged.
N1: PASS – State stays in phase `pap` with N1 explicitly blocked by the continuing 403 issue in `artifacts/state.json:25` and `artifacts/state.json:30`, while the PAP header and Loop 034 note (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:61`) reiterate that status remains draft until the waiver/API fix.

Notes: Keep coordinating with ops on the waiver or API credential so the PAP freeze gate can finally clear.
