DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Repro checkpoint logged before edits (analysis/decision_log.csv:498-507) and the refreshed session info/seed snapshot (artifacts/session_info.txt:1-11; artifacts/seed.txt:1) plus the QC note on the re-run (qc/data_checks.md:46-53) keep deterministic reruns documented.
L1: PASS – Loop49 captures the failed Semantic Scholar call and stored payload (lit/queries/loop_049/query_001.json:1-18) and wires the CrossRef fallback through the evidence trail (lit/queries/loop_049/crossref_query_002.json:1; lit/evidence_map.csv:48; lit/bibliography.bib:541-549), satisfying the literature logging rules.
P1: PASS – Notebook entries confirm no public tables/figures were produced (notebooks/research_notebook.md:364-371) while the QC risk log reiterates disclosure controls and recent checks (qc/data_checks.md:50-53).
N1: PASS – PAP stays explicitly in draft status until the Semantic Scholar gate clears (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-18) and the state file keeps phase=pap with N1 blocked and the dated ops escalations recorded (artifacts/state.json:25-74).

Notes: Please update the header of qc/data_checks.md to Loop 049 so the checkpoint label matches the current log.
