DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Seed 20251016 stays logged in artifacts/seed.txt and the reruns documented in analysis/decision_log.csv (run_models_loop059, pseudo_weight_sensitivity_loop059, etc.) plus the MANIFEST update cover the deterministic commands for loop 059 outputs.
L1: PASS – Semantic Scholar query saved at lit/queries/loop_059/query_001.json with the CrossRef fallback in lit/queries/loop_059/crossref_query_001.json, and DOI 10.1332/17579597y2024d000000035 appears in lit/evidence_map.csv plus lit/bibliography.bib/json for [CLAIM:C2].
P1: PASS – qc/disclosure_check_loop_059.md documents the n ≥ 10 audit for tables/results_summary.csv and figures/dag_design.png with `violations: 0` using analysis/code/disclosure_check.py, so no small-cell leaks occurred.
N1: PASS – artifacts/state.json stays in phase “sensitivity” (phase_ix=3) with next actions N8–N12 still pending, so the gating rationale toward writing/review remains intact.
