DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Loop 023 logged the reviewer sync, reproducibility checkpoint, and runner auto-log (`analysis/decision_log.csv:208-218`), while `artifacts/session_info.txt:1-10` and `artifacts/checksums.json:1-8` plus `qc/data_checks.md:47-58` show seeds, environment, and regeneration commands remain current.
L1: PASS – The mandated Semantic Scholar call and 403 payload are archived (`lit/queries/loop_023/query_001.json:1-20`), the CrossRef fallback is saved (`lit/queries/loop_023/crossref_query_001.json:1-40`), and the new Van Alen DOI propagates through the evidence map (`lit/evidence_map.csv:21`) and bibliographies, satisfying literature logging during the outage.
P1: PASS – Disclosure guardrails stay explicit (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:43-48`), the latest QC note reiterates no public tables or figures were produced (`qc/data_checks.md:50-53`), and the most recent disclosure audit still reports `violations: 0` (`qc/disclosure_check_loop_006.md:1-17`), so privacy risk is unchanged.
N1: PASS – State remains in the PAP phase with next action N1 explicitly blocked by the unresolved Semantic Scholar credential (`artifacts/state.json:1-42`), and the PAP header still reads `status: draft` with the Loop 023 blocker note (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-37`), so gating is justified.

Notes: Resolving the Semantic Scholar key or securing the documented waiver is still the critical path to freezing the PAP.
