**Updates**
- PAP draft now spells out the seed discipline, disclosure guardrails, exploratory sample sizes, and a deterministic execution order so the freeze gate is explicit (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-89`).
- Hypothesis registry and research notebook flag H1–H3 as `in_PAP`, tie them to the implemented scripts, and document the Loop 4 reviewer response plus remaining blockers (`analysis/hypotheses.csv:3-5`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:59-70`).
- QC artifacts record the current loop/date and embed the planned disclosure workflow, including a ready-to-fill suppression checklist (`qc/data_checks.md:1-49`, `qc/disclosure_check_loop_004.md:1-19`).
- Literature governance shows the latest Semantic Scholar failure while state tracking now lists DAG/identification and imputation/BH automation as next actions (`lit/queries/loop_004/query_001.json:1-10`, `artifacts/state.json:1-61`). No tests run—work was documentation/planning.

**Next Steps**
1. Restore Semantic Scholar access or obtain a waiver so the PAP can freeze.
2. Draft the DAG figure plus `reports/identification.md` to document the descriptive stance.
3. Build the imputation and Benjamini–Hochberg automation scripts referenced in the PAP execution order.

Status: Logged the reviewer response, documented another Semantic Scholar 403, and hardened PAP/QC artifacts (privacy guardrails, sample sizes, disclosure template). PAP remains draft until the API recovers and identification/DAG artifacts exist; next priority is unblocking literature plus drafting the DAG + imputation automation.
