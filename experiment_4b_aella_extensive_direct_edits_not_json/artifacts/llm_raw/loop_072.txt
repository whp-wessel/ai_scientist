- Logged the loop_072 Semantic Scholar replay (still 403) plus the CrossRef fallback and the loop_071 review summary so release-phase literatures stay auditable while the OPS waiver sits active (`analysis/decision_log.csv:808-812` and the saved payloads under `lit/queries/loop_072/`), and documented that N1 remains a WARN until the key is restored.
- Added Nature Mental Health and ESRI Growing Up in Ireland references for [CLAIM:C1], keeping the evidence map and dual bibliography formats in sync with the new DOI-backed sources (`lit/evidence_map.csv:61-62`, `lit/bibliography.bib:653-674`, and `lit/bibliography.json:1108-1146`).
- Recorded the new attempt/fallback entries in the waiver ledger so the OPS ticket response, persistent 403, and CrossRef metadata are auditable (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:163-172`).
- Bumped `loop_counter` to 72 and refreshed the N8 note so the release gate explicitly cites the loop_072 CrossRef evidence while keeping the Semantic Scholar replay pending (`artifacts/state.json:26-34`).

Testing: not run; not requested.

Next steps:
1. Wait for OPS-S2-2025-11-09-01 to restore the semantic scholar key, rerun the blocked query, replace the CrossRef placeholders in the evidence map/bibliography with the real response, and log the change in `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md`.
2. Once the true Semantic Scholar payload is captured, verify the release-phase checklist/disclosure assets, mark N8/N16 complete, and proceed with the final release gate.

Status: Reran the loop_072 Semantic Scholar search (still 403), captured the CrossRef fallback, refreshed the Claim C1 references/evidence, and logged the release-phase review/state updates so the gating stays auditable; next priority is to rerun the blocked query once OPS-S2-2025-11-09-01 restores the key and then close N8 before final release.
