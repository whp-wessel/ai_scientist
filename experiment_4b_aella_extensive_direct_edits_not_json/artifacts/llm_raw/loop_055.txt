- Confirmatory outputs are back online now that the PAP metadata is a plain `status: frozen` block (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-5); `analysis/results.csv:1-5` holds the BH-adjusted H1–H3 estimates plus NC1, and `tables/results_summary.*` were rebuilt around those rows for reporting.

- The updated sensitivity story documents the pseudo-weight, design-effect, and pseudo-replicate scenarios and the decision to keep SRS+HC1 as the default (analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:1-34), the findings log now narrates those outputs (reports/findings_v1.0.md:6-31), and the new loop summary file captures the deltas for the manuscript team (reports/findings_summary.md:5-13).

- Documentation/performance tracking reflects the reruns: the decision log records the reviewer STOP and every rerun plus plan update (analysis/decision_log.csv:581-595), the disclosure audit certifies n≥10 compliance for the refreshed tables (qc/disclosure_check_loop_055.md:1-14), and the state file now shows loop 55 with N8/N11/N12 still pending (artifacts/state.json:25-45).

Tests: not run (not requested).

Next steps:
1. Refresh `papers/main/*`, `reports/identification.md`, and the manuscript outline with `analysis/results.csv`, the sensitivity artifacts, and `qc/disclosure_check_loop_055.md` so the knit manuscript reflects the new evidence (see N11 in artifacts/state.json:35-37).
2. Continue logging Semantic Scholar retries and round out the STROBE/SAMPL checklists so N8/N12 can be closed before the writing/review push (artifacts/state.json:27-45).
