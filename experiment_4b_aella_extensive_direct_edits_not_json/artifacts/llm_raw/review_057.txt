DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – seed 20251016 remains recorded (`artifacts/seed.txt:1`) and the loop reruns for H1–H3, the negative control, BH adjustment, and disclosure audit are traced in `analysis/decision_log.csv` (see `run_models_all`, `negative_control`, `calc_bh`, `table_results_summary`, `disclosure_check` entries), keeping regeneration deterministic.
L1: PASS – Semantic Scholar outages for loops 056/057 are archived under `lit/queries/loop_056/query_001.json` and `lit/queries/loop_057/query_001.json` and the “403 attempt” context is noted in `lit/evidence_map.csv`, so literature logging stays compliant despite the credential block.
P1: PASS – `qc/disclosure_check_loop_056.md` certifies that `tables/results_summary.csv` (n≥13,507) and `figures/dag_design.png` were audited with `violations: 0` at the 10-cell threshold, ensuring no small-cell disclosures.
N1: PASS – The experiment remains in the sensitivity phase with pending next actions (N8/N11/N12 in `artifacts/state.json`) explicitly calling for Semantic Scholar replay, manuscript integration, and QC checklist updates before writing, so gating is consistent.
