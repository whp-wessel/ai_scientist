**Loop 006 Work**
- Rebuilt the missing identification artifacts: `reports/identification.md:1-25` now states the descriptive stance and cites the regenerated DAG command, while `papers/main/MANIFEST.md:7-9` and `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:20-26` link manuscripts and PAP back to `figures/dag_design.*`, clearing the reviewer’s R1 failure.
- Regenerated the deterministic MI stack so the promised clean data exist again; see `artifacts/imputation_summary_loop005.json:1-8` for the seeded run metadata and `analysis/decision_log.csv:44-46` for the reproducibility log referencing `data/clean/childhood_imputed_stack_loop005.csv`.
- Closed backlog N5 by adding the reusable disclosure scanner `analysis/code/disclosure_check.py:19-118`, running it to produce `qc/disclosure_check_loop_006.md:1-17`, and surfacing the automation in the PAP and notebook (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:20-26`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:79-91`).
- Hardened literature governance so failed API calls are still auditable: `scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py:61-150` now captures HTTP errors, and Loop 006’s required query is preserved at `lit/queries/loop_006/query_001.json:1-14` with the failure logged in `analysis/decision_log.csv:49-50`.
- Governance artifacts were synchronized to document the reviewer STOP remediation and remaining block: `analysis/decision_log.csv:43-52` narrates the steps, and `artifacts/state.json:3-64` now shows loop_counter=6 with N3–N5 done while keeping N1 blocked pending a working S2 credential.

**Next Steps**
1. Secure a functioning Semantic Scholar key or written waiver so the PAP can satisfy its literature gate and move to a frozen status.
2. Once literature access is restored, freeze `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md` (status/registry/freeze_commit) and queue the confirmatory scripts with BH + disclosure automation.

Status: Reviewer STOP cleared by recreating DAG, identification memo, imputation stack, and disclosure automation; logs/state updated and Semantic Scholar attempt recorded (still 403). Next priority is obtaining a working S2 credential so the PAP can freeze and confirmatory work can begin.
