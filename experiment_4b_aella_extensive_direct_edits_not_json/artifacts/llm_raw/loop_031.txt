**Loop Summary**
- Refreshed the reproducibility checkpoint by regenerating `artifacts/session_info.txt:1-9` and re-validating dataset hashes, then rolled `qc/data_checks.md:1-55` to Loop 031 so the reviewer’s R1 guard remains satisfied.
- Logged the mandatory Semantic Scholar query (still 403) at `lit/queries/loop_031/query_001.json` and captured the matched CrossRef payload at `lit/queries/loop_031/crossref_query_001.json`, keeping the outage trail auditable.
- Added Xu & Zheng 2025 to the evidence system (`lit/evidence_map.csv:29`, `lit/bibliography.bib:324-332`, `lit/bibliography.json:565-583`) and extended the waiver log (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:30-36`); the PAP stays draft but now cites this stress-buffering evidence (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-5,52-55`).
- Documented the loop narrative (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:243-247`) and updated governance state (`artifacts/state.json:25-34`) so loop_counter=31 with N1 still blocked.

**Next Steps**
1. Secure the Semantic Scholar credential or waiver so the PAP can freeze and confirmatory work can begin (`artifacts/state.json:25-34`).
2. Script reproducible parental-warmth, stress, and positive-affect composites referenced in the new PAP note to operationalize the stress-buffering mediators (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:52-55`, `qc/data_checks.md:53-55`).

Status (≤120 words): Loop 31 refreshed session/checksum logs, documented another 403ed Semantic Scholar attempt with the required JSON artifacts, and added the Xu & Zheng parental-warmth stress-buffering DOI so literature governance keeps moving while the outage persists. The PAP remains draft with an updated blocker note, QC/state artifacts reference the new evidence, and no public tables/figures were produced. Next priority is still restoring Semantic Scholar access (or finalizing the waiver) and scripting the warmth/stress transformations that the new citation motivates.
