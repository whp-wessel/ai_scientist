**Loop 35 Work**
- Regenerated the reproducibility artifacts and rolled the QC log to the current loop so reviewer R1 stays satisfied before any edits (`artifacts/session_info.txt:1`, `artifacts/checksums.json:1`, `qc/data_checks.md:1`).
- Logged the required Semantic Scholar attempt (still HTTP 403) plus a CrossRef fallback, then registered the mentorship toxic-stress study across the evidence map, bibliographies, and waiver trail to keep L1 moving despite the outage (`lit/queries/loop_035/query_001.json:1`, `lit/queries/loop_035/crossref_query_001.json:1`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:33`, `lit/bibliography.bib:371`, `lit/bibliography.json:645`, `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:6`, `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:72`).
- Maintained the PAP as draft while adding the Loop 35 blocker note that ties the new mentorship biomarker evidence to the pending estimand/specification work (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:63`).
- Synchronized governance artifacts so the notebook narrative, QC risks, and state file all reflect loop_counter = 35, N1 still blocked, and no public tables/figures (P1) were produced this hour (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:268`, `qc/data_checks.md:50`, `artifacts/state.json:25`).

**Next Steps**
1. Secure either restored Semantic Scholar credentials or a formal waiver so the PAP freeze gate can finally clear.
2. Draft mentorship/support proxy coding (e.g., survey mentorship items, biomarker placeholders) so the new literature can flow directly into the PAP once literature access stabilizes.
3. Map the pending robustness/power checks for H1–H3 so they are ready to execute immediately after the PAP is frozen.

Status: Loop 35 kept PAP in draft while we refreshed reproducibility artifacts, logged the still-failing Semantic Scholar query, and added the mentorship toxic-stress DOI + waiver updates. Next priority is clearing the literature gate (credential or waiver) so PAP freeze work can proceed.
