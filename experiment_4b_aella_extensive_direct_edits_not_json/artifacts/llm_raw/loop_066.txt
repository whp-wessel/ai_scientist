Re-synced loop 066’s sensitivity narrative by rerunning the pseudo-weight, design-effect, and pseudo-replicate scripts with loop-specific outputs, updating the reproducibility manifest, and documenting the refreshed context before the writing-phase QC milestone.

- Captured the new Scenario 1–3 results (with effective-n/SE/CV values) and the SRS+HC1 default choice in `analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:16`, and recorded both the standard and loop-066 command/output paths for each script in `analysis/sensitivity_manifest.md:5`.
- Refreshed the human-readable narrative in `reports/findings_summary.md:5` and bumped the findings log to `reports/findings_v1.4.md:1`, noting that no public tables/figures were released and writing-phase QC remains next.
- Logged the review response plus every rerun in `analysis/decision_log.csv:742`/`743` and bumped `loop_counter` to 66 while keeping N14 (writing-phase QC/review prep) as pending in `artifacts/state.json:24`/`55`.
- Updated the notebook and reproducibility metadata (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:419`, `artifacts/session_info.txt:1`, `artifacts/repro_report.md:1`) so the literature/repro record reflects the latest deterministic commands and environment snapshot.

Next steps:
1. Execute the writing-phase QC pass (manuscript/outline parity, STROBE/SAMPL checklist, DAG/identification note, and LaTeX rebuild) as sketched in `reports/findings_summary.md:12`.
2. Continue logging Semantic Scholar/CrossRef queries so each `[CLAIM:<ID>]` stays DOI-backed before advancing toward review.

Status: Loop 066 reran the seeded pseudo-weight, design-effect, and pseudo-replicate scenarios (see the new `outputs/sensitivity_*_loop066` artifacts) and refreshed the narrative/logging artifacts so the writing-phase QC for N14 is the next priority.
