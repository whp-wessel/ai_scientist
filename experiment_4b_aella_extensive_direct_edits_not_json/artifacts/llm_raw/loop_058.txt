- Rebuilt the confirmatory/BH pipeline so the seeded PAP estimates (with `q` values and `bh_in_scope` metadata) are captured in `analysis/results.csv:1` and exported to the publication-ready `tables/results_summary.csv:1`/`.md` with the same deterministic command history.
- Updated the Loop 058 synthesis narrative (`analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:1`) and findings log (`reports/findings_summary.md:1`) to describe the rerun models, the pseudo-weight/design-effect/pseudo-replicate scenarios, and the new disclosure audit.
- Logged the latest disclosure check and literature bookkeeping: `qc/disclosure_check_loop_058.md:1` verifies `n ≥ 10` for `tables/results_summary.csv` and `figures/dag_design.png`, while the Semantic Scholar 403 plus CrossRef fallback are archived in `lit/queries/loop_058/query_001.json:1`/`lit/queries/loop_058/crossref_query_001.json:1` and the DOI-backed evidence-map row at `lit/evidence_map.csv:52`.
- Refreshed the run state (`artifacts/state.json:1`) to loop 58, kept the sensitivity phase, and added notes that the new literature log and sensitivity assets now feed into the upcoming manuscript/outline work.

Scripts executed: `analysis/code/run_models.py`, `analysis/code/negative_control.py`, `analysis/code/summarize_results.py`, `analysis/code/calc_bh.py`, `analysis/code/build_results_summary.py`, `analysis/code/pseudo_weight_sensitivity.py`, `analysis/code/design_effect_grid.py`, `analysis/code/pseudo_replicates.py`, `analysis/code/disclosure_check.py`, `scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py` (403), plus the CrossRef fetch.

Next steps:
1. Integrate the regenerated confirmatory and sensitivity outputs (including `qc/disclosure_check_loop_058.md` and the new evidence-map entry) into `papers/main/*`, `reports/identification.md`, and the manuscript outline so every `[CLAIM:<ID>]` cites reproducible artifacts (N11).
2. Update `qc/strobe_sampl_checklist.md`, `qc/measures_validity.md`, and the decision log with these latest results before shifting fully toward the writing/review checklist (N12).
3. Continue logging Semantic Scholar attempts (and crossref fallbacks) while the S2 credential waiver remains active so the literature gate stays auditable (N8).
