**Key Updates**
- Logged reviewer items plus reproducibility confirmations in `analysis/decision_log.csv:208-217`, covering the Loop 022 critique (R1/L1/P1/N1), the fresh session+checksum check, and every literature/PAP/QC/state action taken this hour.
- Captured the mandated Semantic Scholar attempt (`lit/queries/loop_023/query_001.json`) and paired CrossRef metadata (`lit/queries/loop_023/crossref_query_001.json`) so the outage trail remains auditable.
- Added Van Alen et al. 2020 (HF-HRV mediation) across the evidence system—see `lit/evidence_map.csv:21`, `lit/bibliography.bib:236-243`, and `lit/bibliography.json:398-413`—giving H2 a physiological pathway citation while S2 access is blocked.
- Extended the waiver dossier through Loop 023, including the new 403 log row and DOI reference (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1-52`), keeping governance reviewers current.
- Kept the PAP in draft but refreshed metadata/timestamps plus a Loop 023 blocker note detailing the HF-HRV mechanism (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-5,37`).
- Rolled the QC checklist forward with the latest reproducibility verification and outage risk note (`qc/data_checks.md:1,47-53`) and mirrored the narrative in the research notebook (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:191-197`).
- Updated backlog/state to loop_counter = 23 with N1 still blocked pending a working Semantic Scholar key or waiver approval (`artifacts/state.json:25-40`).

**Next Steps**
1. Coordinate with ops to restore the Semantic Scholar credential or secure the waiver so the PAP can freeze.
2. Once literature gate clears, finalize PAP robustness specs (e.g., HF-HRV mediator, stress interactions) and prep freeze commit/tag.

Status (≤120 words): Loop 023 logged the reviewer response, reproducibility check, and another failed Semantic Scholar call (403) alongside a CrossRef fallback highlighting the parental-warmth → HF-HRV pathway. PAP, QC log, waiver memo, and notebook now cite this blocker, and state shows loop_counter = 23 with N1 still blocked until the credential/waiver clears.
