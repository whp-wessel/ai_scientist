DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Seed 20251016/environment captured in `artifacts/session_info.txt:1` plus `reports/findings_v1.8.md:1` while `qc/disclosure_check_loop_070.md:1` records the seeded disclosure command, preserving reproducibility.
L1: PASS – Loop 071 logged the blocked Semantic Scholar call (`lit/queries/loop_071/query_001.json`; `analysis/decision_log.csv:799`) and the CrossRef backup (`lit/queries/loop_071/crossref_query_003.json`; `lit/evidence_map.csv:60`; `lit/bibliography.bib:639`) so [CLAIM:C1] keeps DOI-based coverage.
P1: PASS – `qc/disclosure_check_loop_070.md:1` documents the n≥10 scan of `tables/results_summary.*` and `figures/dag_design.png` with zero violations, echoed in `reports/review_checklist.md:4` before any public release.
N1: WARN – Release-phase artifacts/checklist are updated (`reports/review_checklist.md:4`; `artifacts/state.json:20-35`), but next action N8 (Semantic Scholar replay) remains pending, so the final gate awaits the credential restoration.
Notes: Re-run the archived Semantic Scholar queries once the S2 key recovers and push the responses into the evidence map/bibliography before declaring the release gate satisfied.
