DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Seed 20251016 is on record in analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:3 and the decision log documents the seeded summarization, BH correction, and table rebuild commands at analysis/decision_log.csv:559 and analysis/decision_log.csv:560 so confirmatory outputs remain reproducible.
L1: PASS – The loop-specific Semantic Scholar query/403 payload is logged in analysis/decision_log.csv:562, preserved under lit/queries/loop_053/query_001.json:1, and the waiver ledger records the attempt at lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:58, keeping the literature trail intact despite the outage.
P1: PASS – The disclosure script command and n≥10 threshold appear in qc/disclosure_check_loop_052.md:8 and the resulting “violations: 0” at qc/disclosure_check_loop_052.md:18 confirms no small-cell release.
N1: PASS – State remains in the analysis phase with the Semantic Scholar replay task still pending at artifacts/state.json:77 while the sensitivity memo is marked done at artifacts/state.json:91, and that memo outlines the pseudo-weight/design-effect/replicate scenarios at analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:21 as the next work before writing.
Notes: Execute the planned sensitivity scenarios next loop and keep archiving the 403 query artifacts until Semantic Scholar credentials are restored.
