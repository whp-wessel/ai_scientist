**Updates**
- Logged the Loop‑026 critique response plus reproducibility verification so R1/L1/P1/N1 remain satisfied (`analysis/decision_log.csv:253-262`).
- Ran the mandated Semantic Scholar CLI call (403) and captured the CrossRef fallback, adding Lacey et al. 2013 to the evidence map/bibliographies and waiver log; new artifacts live at `lit/queries/loop_027/query_001.json`, `lit/queries/loop_027/crossref_query_001.json`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:25`, `lit/bibliography.bib:277`, `lit/bibliography.json:482`, and `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:30,56`.
- Refreshed PAP + governance files to keep the blocker narrative current (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-47`, `qc/data_checks.md:1-53`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:217-221`, `artifacts/state.json:25-33`).
- The Semantic Scholar invocation also rotated the rate-limit tracker and environment snapshots (`artifacts/.s2_rate_limit.json:1-3`, `artifacts/session_info.txt:1-8`, `artifacts/repro_report.md:1-6`).

Tests: not run; work limited to literature/governance updates.

Next steps:
1. Continue pushing for restored Semantic Scholar credentials or a signed waiver so the PAP can freeze.
2. Begin scripting the parental separation/inflammation covariates (CRP proxies, family disruption indicators) so they are ready when confirmatory work starts.

Loop Status (≤120 words): Logged Loop 27 review + reproducibility checks, archived the latest 403 Semantic Scholar response with a CrossRef fallback (Lacey et al. 2013), and refreshed the PAP, QC, notebook, and state so the waiver trail and blockers stay current. Priority remains fixing the Semantic Scholar credential or obtaining the waiver so the PAP can freeze and we can finalize the warmth/inflammation covariate coding.
