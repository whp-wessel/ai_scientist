Logged the loop‑080 literature work so the release gate has a fresh Semantic Scholar attempt (403) plus a CrossRef fallback while keeping [CLAIM:C1] fully DOI-backed.

- **Literature map** – Captured the blocked CLI call in `lit/queries/loop_080/query_001.json` and the CrossRef fallback in `lit/queries/loop_080/crossref_query_004.json`, and added the new resilience reference at `lit/evidence_map.csv:2` so the evidence map now documents the fallback source.
- **Bibliography** – Added the new Smokowski et al. (1999) entry to both bibliography formats (`lit/bibliography.bib:712` and `lit/bibliography.json:1205`) with the CrossRef fallback tag and the Semantic Scholar 403 note for [CLAIM:C1].
- **Decision log** – Recorded that we addressed the review L1 warning by rerunning the query/fallback and updating the artifacts at `analysis/decision_log.csv:851`, tying it back to `review/research_findings.md`.

Status: Captured the loop-080 literature update (Semantic Scholar attempt plus CrossRef fallback, evidence map, bibliography, and log) so the release literature requirement is satisfied; Next priority: keep the release-phase manuscript/checklists/disclosure artifacts aligned and await the reviewer clearance before publishing.
