Documented loops 078–080 with the latest literature attempt plus a CrossRef fallback and folded Bethell et al. (2019, JAMA Pediatrics) into the evidence map/bibliography so [CLAIM:C1] retains DOI-backed support despite the Semantic Scholar outage.

- `analysis/decision_log.csv:844-847` now records the reviewer follow-up, the loop-078 Semantic Scholar search (403 payload saved at `lit/queries/loop_078/query_001.json`), the loop-079 CrossRef fallbacks (`lit/queries/loop_078/crossref_query_001.json` and `_002.json`), and the loop-080 literature update that connects the new evidence node to downstream artifacts.
- `lit/evidence_map.csv:65` adds the Bethell et al. statewide sample, links it to `lit/queries/loop_078/crossref_query_002.json`, and explicitly notes that the Semantic Scholar call was blocked so the CrossRef metadata is the reproducibility anchor.
- `lit/bibliography.bib:699` and `lit/bibliography.json:1185` now include the `bethell2019positive` entry (accessed 2025-11-09) so both BibTeX and JSON deliverables mirror the evidence map.

Status: Logged the missing loops with the new literature attempt, fallback, and bibliography refresh; the next priority is to keep the reviewer/archiving track aligned before the final release handoff.
