DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – New data-processing ledger lists every derived artifact with the global seed 20251016 and copy-paste commands (analysis/data_processing.md:1-118), and the PAP/QC files restate freeze blockers plus deterministic scripts, keeping reproducibility auditable (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:13-40; qc/data_checks.md:6-54).
L1: PASS – Loop 007 recorded the mandatory Semantic Scholar call in the decision log and saved the full 403 payload/parameters under lit/queries, satisfying the literature logging requirement despite the credential failure (analysis/decision_log.csv:54; lit/queries/loop_007/query_001.json:1-14).
P1: PASS – The PAP reiterates the n≥10 disclosure guard with the automated check reference and the QC checklist confirms only aggregate counts were produced (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:17-25; qc/data_checks.md:33-54), so no small-cell risk emerged.
N1: PASS – State stays in the PAP phase with N1 explicitly marked blocked until a working Semantic Scholar key arrives, aligning with the PAP freeze criteria and preventing premature phase advancement (artifacts/state.json:1-44; analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:7-25).

Notes: Resolving the Semantic Scholar credential remains the gating dependency before PAP freeze.
