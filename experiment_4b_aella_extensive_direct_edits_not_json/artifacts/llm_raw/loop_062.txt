Status: Completed the confirmatory rerun, seeded sensitivity suite (pseudo weights, DEFF grid, pseudo replicates), measurement/QC refresh, and manuscript/report alignment for loop 062; next priority is the writing-phase QC/build (N13).

- Rebuilt `analysis/results.csv` (plus pre-BH CSV) from the latest run_models JSONs, applied BH, regenerated tables, and recorded the updates in `analysis/decision_log`/`analysis/sensitivity_plan`; pseudo weights/design-effect grid/pseudo replicates outputs now live under `outputs/sensitivity_*` with the seeded uncertainty envelope.
- Refreshed the measurement dossier (`qc/measures_validity.md`, `artifacts/measurement_validity_loop061.json`), reran the disclosure check (`qc/disclosure_check_loop_061.md`), updated `qc/strobe_sampl_checklist.md`, and documented the changes in `reports/findings_summary.md`, `reports/findings_v1.1.md`, and `notebooks/research_notebook.md`.
- Synced the manuscript, LaTeX twin, outline, identification memo, and bibliography status with the new artifacts, logged the loop’s R1/L1/P1/N1 response, and bumped `artifacts/state.json` to loop 62 with N11/N12 done and a new N13 for writing-phase QC.

Next steps:
1. Execute the writing-phase QC/build: refresh STROBE/SAMPL as needed, run `latexmk -pdf papers/main/manuscript.tex` (log `LaTeX build: PASS` in `papers/main/build_log.txt`), and re-run disclosure scans for any new tables/figures before moving toward review.
2. Continue logging blocked Semantic Scholar queries and CrossRef fallbacks (N8) until the S2 key or waiver clears so each `[CLAIM:<ID>]` stays DOI-backed.
