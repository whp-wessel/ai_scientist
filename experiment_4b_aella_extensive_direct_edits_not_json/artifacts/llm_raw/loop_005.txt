**Key Updates**
- Created a deterministic DAG renderer plus PNG/JSON outputs so the descriptive stance is visual and reproducible; the command is now logged in the manifest and paired with an identification memo that enumerates the confounding/assumption set (`analysis/code/plot_dag.py:23`, `papers/main/MANIFEST.md:7`, `reports/identification.md:8`).
- Implemented the hot-deck multiple-imputation stacker and executed it with `m=5`, logging both diagnostics and the automatic CSV fallback when parquet engines are unavailable; the same loop added a Benjamini–Hochberg utility that appends `q_value` and `bh_in_scope` once confirmatory p-values exist (`analysis/code/impute_and_stack.py:22`, `analysis/code/impute_and_stack.py:101`, `artifacts/imputation_summary_loop005.json:4335`, `analysis/code/calc_bh.py:32`).
- Refreshed the PAP, notebook, and state to cite the new tooling, loop-005 DAG output, and outstanding disclosure tasks while keeping the literature gate explicitly blocked by the continuing 403 response from Semantic Scholar (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:16`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:71`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:89`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:66`, `artifacts/state.json:31`, `lit/queries/loop_005/query_001.json:1`).

**Validation**
- `python analysis/code/impute_and_stack.py --m 5 --stacked-output data/clean/childhood_imputed_stack_loop005.parquet --summary-output artifacts/imputation_summary_loop005.json --seed 20251016`

**Next Steps**
1. Restore Semantic Scholar access or obtain a waiver so the PAP can clear the literature gate and freeze (`artifacts/state.json:31`).
2. Wire the disclosure-check automation into the execution order before producing any tables (new N5 action) and keep PAP status `draft` until that control is verified (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:89`).
3. Coordinate with the sponsor about the empty `mentalillness` field and decide whether the imputed stack should feed H2 controls once the data issue is resolved (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:45`).

Loop Status (≤120 words): Logged reviewer items, re-ran the required Semantic Scholar query (still 403), and built the DAG + identification memo plus MI/BH automation with reproducible commands. PAP, notebook, and state now cite the new tooling and record that the literature gate remains blocked. Next priority is unblocking Semantic Scholar (or getting a waiver) so the PAP can freeze while we wire the disclosure checklist automation and resolve the missing `mentalillness` control.
