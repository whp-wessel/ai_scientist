**Governance & PAP**
- PAP header stays `status: draft` with a fresh timestamp and a Loop 048 blocker note spelling out the Glenn (2014) fallback and the scheduled 9 Nov ops memo / 10 Nov support ticket, keeping the gate rationale explicit (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:89`).
- Project state now reflects `loop_counter=48`, phase `pap`, and backlog item N1 flagged as blocked by the Loop 048 403 plus the queued escalations (`artifacts/state.json:25`, `artifacts/state.json:30`).

**Literature Diligence**
- Recorded the mandated Semantic Scholar query failure for “childhood mentor buffering adult mental health resilience” and archived it for the waiver audit trail (`lit/queries/loop_048/query_001.json:1`).
- Captured the paired CrossRef payload and propagated Glenn’s spirituality-based mentoring evidence across the evidence map and both bibliographies to keep H2 coverage moving during the outage (`lit/queries/loop_048/crossref_query_001.json:1`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:47`, `lit/bibliography.bib:527`, `lit/bibliography.json:912`).
- Extended the waiver memo with the Loop 048 attempt plus Glenn (2014) so ops has an up‑to‑date log when the memo/ticket go out (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:97`).

**Repro/QC & Notebook**
- Regenerated the reproducibility snapshot via `python runner.py --dry-run` and refreshed the report to keep the current env/seed/hash context ahead of further edits (`artifacts/session_info.txt:1`, `artifacts/repro_report.md:1`).
- Rolled `qc/data_checks.md` to Loop 048, capturing the 23:03Z reproducibility checkpoint and the updated Semantic Scholar blocker narrative (`qc/data_checks.md:1`, `qc/data_checks.md:46`).
- Logged the full narrative (review response, repro checkpoint, 403 attempt, Glenn fallback, governance updates) in the research notebook for end-to-end traceability (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:357`).

Next steps:
1. Dispatch the 2025‑11‑09 ops memo (and, if needed, the 2025‑11‑10 Semantic Scholar support ticket) and record both actions in the decision log/waiver artifacts.
2. Once API access or the waiver is confirmed, finish literature gating so the PAP can freeze and unlock confirmatory analysis.

Status (≤120 words): Loop 048 focused on governance while the Semantic Scholar outage persists—logged the latest review directives, reran the reproducibility snapshot, executed the mandated query (403) with CrossRef fallback, and wired Glenn 2014 into the evidence map, bibliographies, waiver memo, PAP, QC, notebook, and state. Next priority is executing the scheduled ops memo/support ticket so the PAP freeze gate can finally lift once S2 access or a formal waiver lands.
