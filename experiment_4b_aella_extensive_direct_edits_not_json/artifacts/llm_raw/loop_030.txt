**Updates**
- Logged the Loop‑29 reviewer directives plus every action this hour in `analysis/decision_log.csv:284-293`, keeping the audit trail aligned with R1/L1/P1/N1 checkpoints (review sync, reproducibility verification, 403 attempt, CrossRef fallback, waiver, PAP/QC/notebook/state updates).
- Regenerated the environment snapshot (`artifacts/session_info.txt:1-12`) and cited it in the refreshed QC checklist (`qc/data_checks.md:1-55`), confirming the seed, session info, and checksum ledger were current before editing PAP artifacts.
- Ran the mandated Semantic Scholar search (`python scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py …`), captured the HTTP‑403 payload at `lit/queries/loop_030/query_001.json:1`, and mirrored the CrossRef fallback at `lit/queries/loop_030/crossref_query_001.json:1`; the waiver memo now documents loops 008‑030 plus the new attachment DOI (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1-39`).
- Added Oh & Han (2019) to the evidence system (`lit/evidence_map.csv:28`, `lit/bibliography.bib:313-323`, `lit/bibliography.json:545-563`) so H2’s mediator plan now includes attachment‑anxiety pathways even while S2 access is blocked.
- Updated the PAP header/loop note (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-33`), notebook narrative (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:237-241`), and project state (`artifacts/state.json:25-33`) to reflect loop_counter 30, the ongoing S2 blocker, and the need to script DERS/maternal‑paternal warmth variables before freeze.

**Next Steps**
1. Continue pursuing Semantic Scholar credential restoration or approval of the documented waiver so the literature gate can clear.
2. Begin drafting reproducible transformations for the DERS composite and maternal/paternal warmth indicators cited in the PAP blocker list.
3. Once the literature gate is cleared, finalize PAP freeze (status + registry URL) so confirmatory analysis can start.

Status: Logged review + reproducibility checks, recorded the mandatory (still failing) S2 query with CrossRef fallback, propagated Oh & Han 2019 through all literature artifacts, refreshed PAP/QC/notebook/state, and kept the project in PAP phase; priority remains securing S2 access or waiver so the PAP can freeze.
