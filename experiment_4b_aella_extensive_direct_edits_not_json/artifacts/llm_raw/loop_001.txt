- Logged the continuing Semantic Scholar 403 plus CrossRef fallback output so every query is reproducible (`lit/queries/loop_001/query_001.json:1`, `lit/queries/loop_001/query_002.json:1`, `lit/queries/loop_001/query_003.json:1`, `lit/queries/loop_001/query_004.json:1`, `lit/queries/loop_001/query_003_detail.json:1`). Evidence tracking now lists DOI-backed sources for C1–C3 and the bibliography files mirror them (`lit/evidence_map.csv:1`, `lit/bibliography.bib:1`, `lit/bibliography.json:1`), with narrative context recorded in the notebook (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:35-50`).

- Moved the project into the PAP phase while keeping the plan in draft status and flagging backlog progress/blocks (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-5`, `artifacts/state.json:3-44`). Loop counter incremented, B3 marked done, and N1 still blocked pending a working S2 key.

- Decision log now captures the reviewer check, failed S2 call, CrossRef sourcing, phase transition, and PAP metadata edit to maintain traceability (`analysis/decision_log.csv:13-17`).

Next steps:
1. Restore Semantic Scholar access or document an approved long-term fallback.
2. Populate `qc/measures_validity.md` with coding/reliability for H1–H3 variables.
3. Build `analysis/code/run_models.py` and related cleaning scripts to enable PAP freeze.

Loop status (≤120 words): Logged S2 outage and captured CrossRef fallback queries, added DOI-backed evidence/bibliography entries, updated the notebook narrative, and advanced the project to the PAP phase while keeping the plan in draft. Next priority is restoring Semantic Scholar access (or formalizing the fallback) so literature sourcing meets policy, then finishing the measurement-validity dossier and model scripts needed for PAP freeze.
