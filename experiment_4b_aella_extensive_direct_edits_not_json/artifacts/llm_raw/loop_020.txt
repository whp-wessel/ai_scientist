**Key Updates**
- Logged the Loop‑20 review response, reproducibility checkpoint, S2 attempt, and every downstream action in `analysis/decision_log.csv:158-183`, preserving the audit trail before any planning.
- Added three new fallback sources (Kasen 2014, Giri 2025, Grummitt 2024) to the evidence system: see `lit/evidence_map.csv:15-17`, `lit/bibliography.bib:175-185`, `lit/bibliography.json:297-333`, and the saved payload `lit/queries/loop_020/crossref_query_002.json:1`.
- Extended the waiver memo with the new DOIs and kept the 403 attempt table current (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:23-41`), while the Loop‑20 PAP note now references all fallback evidence and retains status=draft until the credential/waiver clears (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:31`).
- Refreshed QC and narrative artifacts so the reproducibility gate cites the latest timestamps and literature set (`qc/data_checks.md:1-54`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:173-177`).
- Updated `artifacts/state.json:25-33` to loop_counter 20, leaving phase=PAP with N1 blocked and explicitly listing every DOI currently covering the S2 outage.

**Next Steps**
1. Secure Semantic Scholar access (or formal waiver approval) so the PAP can freeze; replay all queued queries as soon as a key is available.
2. Once the gate clears, finalize PAP freeze metadata (registry URL + freeze commit) and begin preparing confirmatory specs/robustness manifests.

Status (≤120 words): Loop 20 verified reproducibility, captured another S2 403, logged three CrossRef DOIs across the evidence, bibliography, waiver, PAP, QC, and notebook, and kept state in PAP with N1 blocked. Next priority is restoring/waiving Semantic Scholar access so the PAP can freeze.
