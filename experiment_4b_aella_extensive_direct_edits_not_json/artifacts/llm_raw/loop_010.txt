**Updates**
- Logged reviewer response + literature attempt in `analysis/decision_log.csv:73-78` and saved the Loop 010 Semantic Scholar payload (still HTTP 403) at `lit/queries/loop_010/query_001.json:1`. This keeps the mandated per-loop query + governance evidence intact while documenting the continuing credential block.
- Refreshed the PAP metadata (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-14`) and the outstanding-task list (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:91-94`) to keep status=draft, cite the new query, and spell out the waiver-escalation plan required before freeze.
- Updated the reproducibility/QC log to Loop 010 (`qc/data_checks.md:1-54`) and added the matching notebook narrative (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:109-114`), reaffirming the n≥10 disclosure guard plus the latest session/checksum timestamps.
- Advanced the loop counter and next-action notes in `artifacts/state.json:3-36` so the backlog explicitly ties the PAP gate to `lit/queries/loop_010/query_001.json` while acknowledging the waiver draft.

**Next Steps**
1. Draft/send the Semantic Scholar waiver request referencing loops 008–010 while continuing daily CLI attempts in case access is restored.
2. Keep PAP artifacts in draft with updated QC/session checkpoints each loop until a working key or waiver is recorded.
3. Monitor data provider communications about the empty `mentalillness` control so H2 can include the planned adjustment once values exist.

Status: Logged review guidance, ran the required Semantic Scholar query (still 403), refreshed PAP/QC/notebook artifacts, and bumped the state file to loop 10 with the waiver note. Next priority is to secure either working API credentials or a documented waiver so the PAP can move toward freeze without breaking literature governance.
