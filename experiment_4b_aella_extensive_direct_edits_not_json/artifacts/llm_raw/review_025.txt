DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – `qc/data_checks.md:3` restates seed 20251016, `qc/data_checks.md:47` reconfirms the current session/checksum artifacts, and `analysis/decision_log.csv:231` logs the loop-025 reproducibility checkpoint, so determinism remains auditable.
L1: PASS – `analysis/decision_log.csv:232` documents the mandated Semantic Scholar query, `lit/queries/loop_025/query_001.json:1` and `lit/queries/loop_025/crossref_query_001.json:1` preserve the 403 payload and CrossRef fallback, and the Liu & Yin DOI is propagated in `lit/evidence_map.csv:23` and `lit/bibliography.json:443`, meeting literature logging rules.
P1: PASS – `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:45` reiterates the n ≥ 10 disclosure guard, `qc/disclosure_check_loop_006.md:6` and `qc/disclosure_check_loop_006.md:17` show the automated screen with zero violations, and `qc/data_checks.md:50` confirms no public tables/figures this loop, so privacy safeguards hold.
N1: PASS – `artifacts/state.json:25` keeps the project in phase pap with loop_counter 25, `artifacts/state.json:28`/`artifacts/state.json:30` note N1 is still blocked by the Semantic Scholar 403 despite the new DOI, and `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:41` mirrors that blocker, so holding the gate is justified.

Notes: Progress still hinges on restoring the Semantic Scholar credential or securing the documented waiver so the PAP can freeze.
