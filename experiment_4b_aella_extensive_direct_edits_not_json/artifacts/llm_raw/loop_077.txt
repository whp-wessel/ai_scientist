Final release documentation is locked in: `reports/findings_v2.2.md:1` now narrates the reviewer clearance and crossref fallback, `reports/findings_summary.md:1` highlights the new disclosure scan, and `reports/review_checklist.md:1` notes the release gate with the updated audit and state. The decision log now records the disclosure scan, release-doc sync, review log ack, and the state bump to loop 80 (`analysis/decision_log.csv:2025-11-09T23:05:00Z`‑`23:20:00Z`), and `artifacts/state.json:1` documents the new N20 next action so the release package is flagged for archiving.

- Tests: `python analysis/code/disclosure_check.py --tables-dir tables --figures-dir figures --output-md qc/disclosure_check_loop_076.md --min-n 10 --seed 20251016`.
- Next steps: archive the release bundle (PDF/build log/disclosure scan/review checklist/findings_v2.2) and keep monitoring the CrossRef/waiver entries for `[CLAIM:C1]` until Semantic Scholar access returns.

Status: release-phase docs, disclosure audit, and review acknowledgement are complete; Next priority: archive the release assets and await scheduling while watching for new literature evidence if the API heals.
