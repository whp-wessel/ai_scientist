**Loop 034**
- Revalidated reproducibility before editing by regenerating the environment snapshot and citing it in the QC checklist; review sync through the state update is logged in `analysis/decision_log.csv:328` and `analysis/decision_log.csv:338` (`artifacts/session_info.txt:1`, `qc/data_checks.md:1`).
- Mandatory Semantic Scholar search (`python scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py … coping adult resilience`) still returned HTTP 403; the payload is archived for the waiver trail (`lit/queries/loop_034/query_001.json:1`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:330`).
- Captured CrossRef mentoring metadata and added Gasper (2020) across the evidence map and bibliographies to keep H2’s guided-support pathways sourced while the outage continues (`lit/queries/loop_034/crossref_query_002.json:1`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:32`, `lit/bibliography.bib:360`, `lit/bibliography.json:628`).
- Extended the waiver memo to Loop 034, logging the new attempt row plus mentoring rationale so auditors can see ≥27 consecutive 403s and the fallback trail (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1`, `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:70`).
- Kept the PAP in draft status with the new Loop 034 blocker note, refreshed QC/Notebook narratives, and left governance state as PAP phase with N1 still blocked (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:61`, `qc/data_checks.md:53`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:262`, `artifacts/state.json:25`).

- Testing: not run (literature/PAP governance only).

Next steps:
1) Keep escalating for a working Semantic Scholar key or formal waiver approval so the PAP literature gate can finally freeze.  
2) Once the gate clears, lock the PAP (`status: frozen`) and stage confirmatory-ready scripts/commands for H1–H3.

Status: Logged the loop-034 reproducibility, literature, and PAP-governance updates; priority stays on restoring Semantic Scholar access or securing the waiver so the PAP can freeze next.
