Status: Completed the confirmatory rerun, BH correction, and full set of sensitivity scenarios plus the loop_055 Semantic Scholar log; next priority is to wire the new tables and notes into the manuscript/outline/QC checklists before moving toward the writing/review phase.  
- Rebuilt the confirmatory pipeline so `analysis/results.csv:1` now reports H1–H3 with BH q-values and the `targeted=N` negative control, with `analysis/results_pre_bh.csv:1` plus the fresh JSONs (`outputs/run_models_loop056_H1.json:1`, `outputs/negative_control_loop056.json:1`) capturing the deterministic inputs.  
- Updated `analysis/sensitivity_plan.md:1` to narrate the pseudo-weight, design-effect, and pseudo-replicate scenarios drawn from `outputs/sensitivity_pseudo_weights/pseudo_weights_deff_150.json:1`, `outputs/sensitivity_design_effect_grid.csv:1`, and `outputs/sensitivity_replicates/sensitivity_replicates_summary.json:1` so the default SRS + HC1 decision is documented.  
- Logged the loop’s work in `analysis/decision_log.csv:597` and kept the phase counter at 56 with the revised next-action notes in `artifacts/state.json:25`.  
- Archived the loop_055 Semantic Scholar attempt (403) under `lit/queries/loop_055/query_001.json:1` to satisfy the reviewer while the waiver/key remains under repair.  
- Refreshed `reports/findings_summary.md:1` so the manuscript team sees the confirmatory rebuild, sensitivity artifacts, and literature log.

Next steps:  
1. Integrate `analysis/results.csv`, the new sensitivity artifacts, and the disclosure audit into `papers/main/imrad_outline.md:1`/`papers/main/manuscript.tex`/`reports/identification.md` so each claim cites regenerable evidence.  
2. Continue the literature/waiver log and finish the STROBE/SAMPL plus measurement-validity checklists in `qc/strobe_sampl_checklist.md:1` and `qc/measures_validity.md:1` ahead of the writing/review QC suite.
