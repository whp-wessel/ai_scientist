DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – analysis/decision_log.csv (2025-11-09T23:55:00Z entry) and artifacts/session_info.txt capture loop 080’s commands, seed, and git head so the literature update stays reproducible.
L1: PASS – lit/queries/loop_080/query_001.json plus crossref_query_004.json and the new row in lit/evidence_map.csv keep [CLAIM:C1] DOI-backed despite the blocked Semantic Scholar key.
P1: PASS – No tables or figures were published this loop, and qc/disclosure_check_loop_076.md still reports n≥10 with `violations: 0`, so the disclosure guard remains intact.
N1: PASS – artifacts/state.json continues to show phase=release with all next_actions done, so the release-phase gate is still justified while awaiting final reviewer clearance.
Notes: Hold for the final reviewer signal before declaring the release complete; no further artifacts changed in loop 080.
