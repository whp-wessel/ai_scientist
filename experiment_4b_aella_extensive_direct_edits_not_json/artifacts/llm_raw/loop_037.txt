**Loop 37 Work**
- Refreshed reproducibility assets so R1 remains satisfied (`artifacts/session_info.txt:1`, `artifacts/checksums.json:1`) and rolled the QC checklist to Loop 37 with the updated blocker summary (`qc/data_checks.md:1`, `qc/data_checks.md:46`, `qc/data_checks.md:53`). The Semantic Scholar CLI touchpoints also refreshed its throttle log and repro report (`artifacts/.s2_rate_limit.json:1`, `artifacts/repro_report.md:1`).
- Logged the mandated Semantic Scholar attempt (`lit/queries/loop_037/query_001.json:1`), captured the CrossRef fallback (`lit/queries/loop_037/crossref_query_001.json:1`), and propagated Bellis et al. (2017) across the evidence map and bibliographies to strengthen H2’s mentorship mechanism (`lit/evidence_map.csv:35`, `lit/bibliography.bib:396`, `lit/bibliography.json:689`).
- Extended the waiver memo header/attempt log to Loop 37 and documented the new blocker summary so auditors can trace the outage (`lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:1`, `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:40`). The PAP stays draft with the Loop 37 note referencing the trusted-adult evidence (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:67`).
- Documented the narrative in the research notebook (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:280`) and updated state (loop_counter=37, phase=pac, stop_now=false) with the expanded Semantic Scholar task notes (`artifacts/state.json:25`, `artifacts/state.json:72`).

- Tests: not run (documentation-only loop).

- **Next Steps:** 1) Keep pressure on ops for a restored Semantic Scholar credential or approved waiver so the PAP can freeze; 2) Continue scripting mentorship/warmth mediator transformations noted in the PAP/QC blockers.

Loop 37 status: Repro snapshot + QC refreshed, Semantic Scholar failure #30 logged with Bellis trusted-adult DOI fallback, and PAP/waiver/notebook/state updated; still waiting on credential/waiver so confirmatory work stays paused.
