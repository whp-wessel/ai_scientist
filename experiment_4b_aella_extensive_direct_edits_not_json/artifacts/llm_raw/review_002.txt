DECISION: CONTINUE
R1: PASS – Seed 20251016 is carried through the PAP and seed ledger (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:16`, `artifacts/seed.txt:1`) and the QC checklist captures the exact commands for the new scripts, keeping the outputs reproducible (`qc/data_checks.md:11`).
L1: PASS – The required Semantic Scholar attempt is logged despite the 403 (`lit/queries/loop_002/query_001.json:1`) and referenced in the decision log (`analysis/decision_log.csv:19`), while DOI-backed sources remain synced in the evidence map (`lit/evidence_map.csv:2`).
P1: PASS – Only aggregate QC summaries were released, honoring the stated n≥10 disclosure rule (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:17`, `qc/data_overview_loop002.md:1`) and avoiding any small-cell outputs.
N1: PASS – State remains in PAP with explicit next actions for the blocked query and measurement dossier (`artifacts/state.json:5`, `artifacts/state.json:30`) and those gating needs are reiterated in the PAP outstanding-tasks list (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:8`).

Notes: Unblocking Semantic Scholar access and delivering `analysis/code/run_models.py` should stay top priorities before attempting PAP freeze.
