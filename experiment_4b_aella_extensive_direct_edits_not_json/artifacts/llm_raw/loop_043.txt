**Loop 43**

- Logged the reviewer response plus every downstream action in `analysis/decision_log.csv:430-439`; reran `runner.update_reproducibility()` so `artifacts/session_info.txt:1`, `artifacts/checksums.json:1`, and `qc/data_checks.md:1`/`47-48` document the 22:12Z environment/hash snapshot that keeps R1 satisfied.  
- Mandatory Semantic Scholar attempt is preserved at `lit/queries/loop_043/query_001.json:1` (still 403). Its CrossRef fallback (`lit/queries/loop_043/crossref_query_001.json:1`) now anchors the Nature Mental Health editorial across `lit/evidence_map.csv:42`, `lit/bibliography.bib:469`, and `lit/bibliography.json:817`, reinforcing the guidance→resilience storyline.  
- `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md:6`/`46`/`52` now cover loops 008–043, and `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:79`/`158` reiterate that the PAP stays draft until the 9 Nov ops memo and 10 Nov support ticket resolve the credential block.  
- Documentation stays synchronized: `notebooks/research_notebook.md:322` records the loop narrative, `qc/data_checks.md:53` highlights the ongoing risk, and `artifacts/state.json:25-33` keeps phase `pap`, loop_counter=43, and next action N1 flagged blocked.

Next:
1. Dispatch the 2025-11-09 ops memo and archive acknowledgment to satisfy the reviewer-mandated escalation (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:158`).  
2. If the key is still down afterward, send the prepared 2025-11-10 Semantic Scholar support ticket while continuing daily CLI attempts + CrossRef fallbacks.

Status (≤120 words): Logged the Loop 042 review response, refreshed the reproducibility snapshot, archived another Semantic Scholar 403 plus a CrossRef DOI that strengthens the guidance→resilience narrative, extended the waiver memo/PAP blocker notes through Loop 043, and updated the QC, notebook, and state files. Next priority is executing the 9 Nov ops memo (and, if needed, the 10 Nov support ticket) so the Semantic Scholar credential issue can unblock the PAP freeze gate.
