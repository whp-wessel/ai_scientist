Academic Graph API (1.0)
Download OpenAPI specification:Download

Fetch paper and author data from the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph (S2AG).

Some things to note:

If you are using an API key, it must be set in the header x-api-key (case-sensitive).
We have two different IDs for a single paper:
paperId - string - The primary way to identify papers when using our website or this API
corpusId - int64 - A second way to identify papers. Our datasets use corpusId when pointing to papers.

Paper bulk search

Behaves similarly to /paper/search, but is intended for bulk retrieval of basic paper data without search relevance:

Text query is optional and supports boolean logic for document matching.
Papers can be filtered using various criteria.
Up to 1,000 papers will be returned in each call.
If there are more matching papers, a continuation "token" will be present.
The query can be repeated with the token param added to efficiently continue fetching matching papers.

Returns a structure with an estimated total matches, batch of matching papers, and a continuation token if more results are available.
Limitations:
Nested paper data, such as citations, references, etc, is not available via this method.
Up to 10,000,000 papers can be fetched via this method. For larger needs, please use the Datasets API to retrieve full copies of the corpus.
QUERY PARAMETERS

query
required
string
Text query that will be matched against the paper's title and abstract. All terms are stemmed in English. By default all terms in the query must be present in the paper.

The match query supports the following syntax:

+ for AND operation
| for OR operation
- negates a term
" collects terms into a phrase
* can be used to match a prefix
( and ) for precedence
~N after a word matches within the edit distance of N (Defaults to 2 if N is omitted)
~N after a phrase matches with the phrase terms separated up to N terms apart (Defaults to 2 if N is omitted)
Examples:

fish ladder matches papers that contain "fish" and "ladder"
fish -ladder matches papers that contain "fish" but not "ladder"
fish | ladder matches papers that contain "fish" or "ladder"
"fish ladder" matches papers that contain the phrase "fish ladder"
(fish ladder) | outflow matches papers that contain "fish" and "ladder" OR "outflow"
fish~ matches papers that contain "fish", "fist", "fihs", etc.
"fish ladder"~3 mathces papers that contain the phrase "fish ladder" or "fish is on a ladder"
token	
string
Used for pagination. This string token is provided when the original query returns, and is used to fetch the next batch of papers. Each call will return a new token.
fields	
string
A comma-separated list of the fields to be returned. See the contents of the data array in Response Schema below for a list of all available fields that can be returned.

The paperId field is always returned. If the fields parameter is omitted, only the paperId and title will be returned.

Examples: https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search/bulk?query=covid&fields=venue,s2FieldsOfStudy
sort	
string
Provides the option to sort the results by the following fields:

paperId
publicationDate
citationCount
Uses the format field:order. Ties are broken by paperId. The default field is paperId and the default order is asc. Records for which the sort value are not defined will appear at the end of sort, regardless of asc/desc order.

Examples:
publicationDate:asc - return oldest papers first.
citationCount:desc - return most highly-cited papers first.
paperId - return papers in ID order, low-to-high.

Please be aware that if the relevant data changes while paging through results, records can be returned in an unexpected way. The default paperId sort avoids this edge case.
publicationTypes	
string
Restricts results to any of the following paper publication types:

Review
JournalArticle
CaseReport
ClinicalTrial
Conference
Dataset
Editorial
LettersAndComments
MetaAnalysis
News

QUERY PARAMETERS

fields	
string
A comma-separated list of the fields to be returned. See the contents of Response Schema below for a list of all available fields that can be returned. The paperId field is always returned. If the fields parameter is omitted, only the paperId and title will be returned.

Use a period (“.”) for fields that have version numbers or subfields, such as the embedding, authors, citations, and references fields:

When requesting authors, the authorId and name subfields are returned by default. To request other subfields, use the format author.url,author.paperCount, etc. See the Response Schema below for available subfields.
When requesting citations and references, the paperId and title subfields are returned by default. To request other subfields, use the format citations.title,citations.abstract, etc. See the Response Schema below for available subfields.
When requesting embedding, the default Spector embedding version is v1. Specify embedding.specter_v2 to select v2 embeddings.
Examples:
fields=title,url
fields=title,embedding.specter_v2
fields=title,authors,citations.title,citations.abstract

Returns a single snippet that is the highest ranked match.
Each snippet has text, snippetKind, section, annotation data, and score. As well as the following data about the paper it comes from: corpusId, title, authors, and openAccessInfo.

Limitations:
You must include a query.
If you don't set a limit, it will automatically return 10 results.
The max limit allowed is 1000.
QUERY PARAMETERS

fields	
string
A comma-separated list of the fields to be returned with each snippet element.

Paper info and the score are currently always returned. What you can specify using this fields param is which fields under the 'snippet' section (see the response schema) will be returned.

Examples:

fields=snippet.text: you'll get just the text field in the snippet section
fields=snippet.text,snippet.snippetKind: you'll get just the text and snippetKind fields in the snippet section
fields=snippet.annotations.sentences: you'll get just the sentence annotations in the snippet section
In general, you can use periods to identify nested fields (as in the examples above).

Not all fields in the response schema can be identified using this fields param though. E.g. you can't pick what you get within snippet.snippetOffset - you can either get the snippet offset with all the possible snippet offset fields, or you can not get it at all. You also can't provide paper or score or anything under paper, since those are always provided.

If you attempt to identify a field that's not supported, you'll get an error with the relevant field name. E.g.

Unrecognized or unsupported fields: [paper]

If you don't specify the fields param, you'll get a default set of fields in the snippet section. These are the default fields:

snippet.text
snippet.snippetKind
snippet.section
snippet.snippetOffset (including nested start and end)
snippet.annotations.refMentions (including nested start, end, and matchedPaperCorpusId for each element)
snippet.annotations.sentences (including nested start and end for each element)
paperIds	
string
Restricts results to snippets from specific papers. To specify papers, provide a comma-separated list of their IDs. You can provide up to approximately 100 IDs.

The following types of IDs are supported:

<sha> - a Semantic Scholar ID, e.g. 649def34f8be52c8b66281af98ae884c09aef38b
CorpusId:<id> - a Semantic Scholar numerical ID, e.g. CorpusId:215416146
DOI:<doi> - a Digital Object Identifier, e.g. DOI:10.18653/v1/N18-3011
ARXIV:<id> - arXiv.rg, e.g. ARXIV:2106.15928
MAG:<id> - Microsoft Academic Graph, e.g. MAG:112218234
ACL:<id> - Association for Computational Linguistics, e.g. ACL:W12-3903
PMID:<id> - PubMed/Medline, e.g. PMID:19872477
PMCID:<id> - PubMed Central, e.g. PMCID:2323736
URL:<url> - URL from one of the sites listed below, e.g. URL:https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15928v1
URLs are recognized from the following sites:

semanticscholar.org
arxiv.org
aclweb.org
acm.org
biorxiv.org
authors	
string
Restricts results to papers with authors matching the given names, formatted as a comma-separated list (...?authors=name1,name2,...). The search criteria are 'fuzzy', so matches that are close will also return results.


Example: galileo,kepler will return papers that include both an author similar to "galileo" and an author similar to "kepler" as co-authors. This query will also match fuzzy variations like 'keppler' and 'Kepler' (default max 'edit distance' is 2).

Important: Multiple author names are combined with AND logic, meaning results must include all specified authors. Adding more authors will narrow your results, not expand them. To search for papers by any of several authors (OR logic), perform separate searches for each author name. The maximum number of author filters is by default 10 and will return an HTTP code 400 (Bad Request) if more than 10 are supplied.
minCitationCount	
string
Restricts results to only include papers with the minimum number of citations.

Example: minCitationCount=200
insertedBefore	
string
Restricts results to snippets from papers inserted into the index before the provided date (excludes things inserted on the provided date).

Acceptable formats: YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, YYYY
publicationDateOrYear	
string
Restricts results to the given range of publication dates or years (inclusive). Accepts the format <startDate>:<endDate> with each date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

Each term is optional, allowing for specific dates, fixed ranges, or open-ended ranges. In addition, prefixes are supported as a shorthand, e.g. 2020-06 matches all dates in June 2020.

Specific dates are not known for all papers, so some records returned with this filter will have a null value for publicationDate. year, however, will always be present. For records where a specific publication date is not known, they will be treated as if published on January 1st of their publication year.

Examples:

2019-03-05 on March 5th, 2019
2019-03 during March 2019
2019 during 2019
2016-03-05:2020-06-06 as early as March 5th, 2016 or as late as June 6th, 2020
1981-08-25: on or after August 25th, 1981
:2015-01 before or on January 31st, 2015
2015:2020 between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2020
year	
string
Restricts results to the given publication year or range of years (inclusive).

Examples:

2019 in 2019
2016-2020 as early as 2016 or as late as 2020
2010- during or after 2010
-2015 before or during 2015
venue	
string
Restricts results to papers published in the given venues, formatted as a comma-separated list.

Input could also be an ISO4 abbreviation. Examples include:

Nature
New England Journal of Medicine
Radiology
N. Engl. J. Med.
Example: Nature,Radiology will return papers from venues Nature and/or Radiology.
fieldsOfStudy	
string
Restricts results to papers in the given fields of study, formatted as a comma-separated list:

Computer Science
Medicine
Chemistry
Biology
Materials Science
Physics
Geology
Psychology
Art
History
Geography
Sociology
Business
Political Science
Economics
Philosophy
Mathematics
Engineering
Environmental Science
Agricultural and Food Sciences
Education
