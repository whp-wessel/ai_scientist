# Findings Log — Version 2.1
**Date:** 2025-11-09  
**Seed:** 20251016  
**PAP:** Frozen at commit `2b3ee167762ad47af1426ab47d392d38323d1b74`, tag `pap-v1`, registry `https://osf.io/5x8hu`

## Summary
- Reviewer `DECISION: CONTINUE` (loop 075) closes the release gate, so the release dossier now cites the Conkbayir (2023) CrossRef fallback (DOI `10.4324/b23180`) plus the waiver log entries while Semantic Scholar remains blocked; `[CLAIM:C1]` stays DOI-backed via `lit/queries/loop_075/crossref_query_001.json`, `lit/evidence_map.csv`, and `lit/bibliography.*`.
- The release package (review checklist, findings summary, manuscript PDF, LaTeX build log, and `qc/disclosure_check_loop_074.md`) aligns with the frozen PAP and its regeneration commands, so the candidate is ready for dissemination with chain-of-custody documentation.
- The documentation bundle now highlights the final reviewer clearance, the zero-violation disclosure audit, and the release checklist (this file and `reports/review_checklist.md`), making the experiment ready for handoff to publication or archiving.

## Next steps
1. Archive the release artifacts (manuscript PDF, build log, disclosure audit, review checklist, and `reports/findings_v2.1`) for downstream sharing; no new confirmatory work is required until additional instructions appear.
2. Continue logging CrossRef/waiver fallback entries for `[CLAIM:C1]` if the Semantic Scholar key is restored before public release.
3. Wait for journal/release scheduling guidance; treat this experiment as complete unless new directives arrive.
