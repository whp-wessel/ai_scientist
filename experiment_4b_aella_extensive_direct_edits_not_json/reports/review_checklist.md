# Review Checklist — Loop 070

| Concern | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **R1 – Reproducibility & seeds** | ✅ | `analysis/results.csv:1`, `artifacts/seed.txt:1`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:794` |
| **L1 – Literature coverage** | ✅ | `lit/evidence_map.csv:59`, `lit/bibliography.bib:628` |
| **P1 – Disclosure audit** | ✅ | `qc/disclosure_check_loop_069.md:1` |
| **N1 – Review gate & release readiness** | ✅ | `papers/main/build_log.txt:3`, `reports/identification.md:1` |

Notes:
- Reviewer loop_069 requests are satisfied via the checklist above; the new checklist and supporting artifacts legitimize advancing to release with the existing Semantic Scholar replay action still pending in `artifacts/state.json`.
