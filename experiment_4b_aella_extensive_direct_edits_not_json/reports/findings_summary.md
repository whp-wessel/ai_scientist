# Findings Summary — Loop 076
**Date:** 2025-11-09  
**Seed:** 20251016

## Loop updates
- Reviewer `DECISION: CONTINUE` (loop 075) closes the release gate; the release dossier now cites the Conkbayir (2023) CrossRef fallback plus the waiver ledger entry so `[CLAIM:C1]` retains DOI coverage while Semantic Scholar remains offline.
- Release artifacts (review checklist, findings summary, `reports/findings_v2.2`, manuscript PDF, LaTeX build log, and `qc/disclosure_check_loop_076.md`) are aligned with the frozen PAP, so the package is ready for handoff with its recorded regeneration commands.
- No new public tables or figures were released; the authoritative disclosure audit is now `qc/disclosure_check_loop_076.md` with `violations: 0`.

## Next actions
1. Archive this release candidate (manuscript PDF, LaTeX build log, disclosure scan, review checklist, and `reports/findings_v2.2`) for downstream publication while the reviewer clearance is fresh.
2. Keep `lit/semantic_scholar_waiver_loop013.md` and `lit/evidence_map.csv` current with any future CrossRef fallback for `[CLAIM:C1]`, and log new queries if the Semantic Scholar key returns.
3. Wait for a release schedule or further instructions; no additional internal artifacts are required unless new guidance surfaces.
