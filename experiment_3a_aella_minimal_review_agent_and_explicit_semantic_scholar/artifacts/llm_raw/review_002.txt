DECISION: STOP – placeholder artifacts block auditability.

R1 FAIL – Key reproducibility artifacts (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`, `docs/survey_design_notes.md:1`, `analysis/data_dictionary.csv:1`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:1`) contain only narrative summaries rather than the promised content, so no commands, seeds, or procedural detail can be verified.

R2 WARN – The agent claims an SRS justification but `docs/survey_design_notes.md:1` provides no actual design assessment, leaving survey-handling decisions undocumented.

R3 FAIL – Literature tracking files (`lit/bibliography.bib:1`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:1`) lack any structured references or citations, so no evidence can be traced.

R4 PASS – No public tables were generated, so privacy risk is not triggered this loop.

R5 FAIL – Minimum deliverables (pre-analysis plan, design memo, data dictionary, notebook) exist only as one-line descriptions (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`, `analysis/data_dictionary.csv:1`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:1`), meaning the required scaffolding has not actually been created.

Notes: Replace each placeholder line with the full artifact contents before proceeding.
