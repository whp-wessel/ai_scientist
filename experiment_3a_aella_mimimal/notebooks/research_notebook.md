# Research Notebook

## 2025-11-07 -- Bootstrap setup
- Loaded `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` snapshot in pandas to confirm availability (size ~42.5 MB) and inspect key columns covering demographics, religion, socioeconomic markers, and psychosocial items.
- Searched the repository for codebook/config metadata (json/yaml) and found none; recorded TODO in `docs/codebook_status.md` and flagged the need to confirm sampling design.
- Created scaffolding artifacts per charter: `artifacts/state.json`, `analysis/hypotheses.csv`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`, `analysis/results.csv`, and this notebook.
- Drafted four exploratory hypotheses spanning parenting, purity culture, socioeconomic mobility, and mental health; documented them alongside an initial PAP outline (status: draft).
- Seeded literature tracking with an ACE-related reference to contextualize childhood adversity links; planned broader literature sweep in the next loop.
- Logged bootstrap actions in `analysis/decision_log.csv` and captured next steps for literature review + data dictionary work.
