# Codebook & Survey Design Status

- 2025-11-07: Searched repository for codebook/config files (json/yaml) and found none.
- TODO: Request or locate the official codebook describing question text, variable types, and any recodes.
- TODO: Obtain survey design documentation (weights/strata/clusters). Until then, analyses default to an SRS assumption that must be justified explicitly.
