H1,wellbeing_parenting,false,Adults who reported stronger parental guidance during ages 0-12 have higher current self-love scores.,Difference in mean self-love scale between top and bottom terciles of parental guidance score.,I love myself (2l8994l),during ages *0-12*: Your parents gave useful guidance (pqo6jmj),Requires scale construction from Likert responses; will document binning logic.
H2,sexual_attitudes,false,Respondents exposed to purity culture before age 12 are more likely to currently prefer strict monogamy.,Average marginal effect of purity-culture exposure on probability of selecting strictly monogamous preference.,Your current monogamy/nonmonogamy preference? (27iua3o),during ages *0-12*:  taught a purity culture that encouraged abstinance/waiting until marriage (wgbq7hv),Need to harmonize outcome categories (monogamy variable) into binary indicator.
H3,socioeconomic_mobility,false,Higher perceived childhood class status predicts higher adulthood net-worth brackets.,Ordered-logit slope of adult net-worth category on childhood class levels.,Your CURRENT net worth is closest to (nhoz8ia),"When you were a child (0-12 years old), your family was (hxyr6oa)",Will treat both variables as ordered categorical; consider collapsing sparse categories.
H4,mental_health,false,Teens who experienced parental emotional abuse report higher adult anxiety frequencies.,Difference in average anxiety score between respondents reporting vs. not reporting abuse ages 13-18.,I tend to suffer from anxiety (npvfh98)-neg,during ages *13-18*: your parents verbally or emotionally abused you (v1k988q),Investigate whether anxiety scale is coded so higher means more anxiety (neg-coded).
