(2014) for intergenerational mobility benchmarks (H3); recorded both in `lit/bibliography.bib` and `lit/evidence_map.csv` with usage notes.\n- Next: keep searching for codebook/weights, begin a structured data dictionary for priority variables, and weave new literature context into the PAP before freezing it.\n",
