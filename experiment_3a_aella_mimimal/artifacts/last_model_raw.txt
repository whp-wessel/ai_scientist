Obtain official codebook and survey design documentation.\n2. Verify whether any weights or replicate weights are bundled elsewhere in the repo.\n3. Clarify coding for \"-neg\" labeled items (e.g., anxiety) to ensure directionality is interpreted correctly.\n4. Define data-cleaning scripts under version control before moving beyond exploratory summaries.\n",
