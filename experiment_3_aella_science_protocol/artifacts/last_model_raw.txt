However, few have noted the symptomatic relationship of this comorbidity among childhood sexual abuse (CSA) survivors. Therefore, this study's objectives were as follows: (1) to examine the relationship across symptoms between anxiety and depression among CSA survivors; (2) to compare differences between male and female network structures among CSA survivors. Methods A total of 63 Universities and Colleges in Jilin Province, China, covered 96,218 participants in this study, a sub-set data of which met the criteria of CSA was analyzed with the network analysis. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF), measured CSA. Anxiety was measured by the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and depression was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The sex difference between anxiety and depression among CSA survivors was compared. Results 3,479 college students reported the experience of CSA (CTQ-SF total scores >= 8), with a prevalence of 3.62% (95% CI: 3.50-3.73%). Among CSA survivors, control worry, sad mood, and energy were central and bridge symptoms of the anxiety and depression network. Meanwhile, male CSA survivors appeared to have a stronger correlation between guilt and suicide, but female CSA survivors seemed to have a stronger correlation between control worry and suicide. Moreover, the edge of control worry-relax-afraid was stronger in the male network, while the edge of restless-relax was stronger in the female network. Conclusion Control worry, sad mood, and energy are crucial to offer targeted treatment and to relieve anxiety and depression symptoms for CSA survivors. Guilt needs more attention for male CSA survivors, while control worry remains more important for female CSA survivors to reduce suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.\"}]}",

Any change here must be mirrored in LaTeX during the same commit.\n\n## Changelog\n- Added peer-reviewed literature synthesis to contextualize the CSA-anxiety finding.\n- Logged Semantic Scholar query outputs under `lit/queries/` for reproducibility.\n- Updated evidence map and bibliography to replace bootstrap placeholders.\n\n## Abstract\nConfirmatory analyses (n = 14,436) indicate that each one-step increase in childhood class corresponds to a 0.18-point rise in adult self-love on the 7-point agreement scale (95% CI [0.16, 0.20], q approx 3.9e-51), roughly 0.10 standard deviations. Contrary to the preregistered direction, respondents reporting any childhood sexual abuse agreement average 0.49 points lower on the anxiety agreement scale (95% CI [-0.56, -0.42], q approx 6.9e-41), about a quarter of a standard deviation. All estimates rely on HC3 OLS under a simple random sampling assumption and are reproducible with seed 20251016.\n\n## Methods\n- Data source: `data/raw/childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` (SHA-256 logged in `artifacts/checksums.json`).\n- Derived dataset: `data/clean/childhoodbalancedpublic_with_csa_indicator.csv` regenerated via  \n  `python analysis/code/derive_csa_indicator.py --dataset data/raw/childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv --out-dataset data/clean/childhoodbalancedpublic_with_csa_indicator.csv --out-distribution tables/csa_indicator_distribution.csv --config config/agent_config.yaml --codebook-in docs/codebook.json --codebook-out docs/codebook.json`.\n- Confirmatory scope: HYP-001 and HYP-003 (see `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`, frozen 2025-11-04T07:58:50Z).\n- Statistical plan: HC3 OLS under SRS assumption; Benjamini-Hochberg at q=0.05 within confirmatory family; robustness checks pre-specified in the PAP.\n\n## Results\n- **HYP-001 (Wellbeing family)**: Childhood class exhibits a positive association with adult self-love (beta = 0.181, SE = 0.012; 95% CI [0.158, 0.205]; q = 3.9e-51). Interpreted against the outcome's SD (1.86), the estimate equals approx0.10 SD and implies ~0.5-point difference when comparing individuals three class steps apart, holding age, gender, and cis identity constant.\n- **HYP-003 (MentalHealth family)**: Any CSA exposure is linked to -0.491 points on the anxiety agreement scale (SE = 0.037; 95% CI [-0.562, -0.419]; q = 6.9e-41). Because the negative-coded outcome maps higher agreement to positive values, the negative coefficient means CSA-exposed respondents report *lower* agreement with \"I tend to suffer from anxiety,\" opposite to the preregistered expectation of higher anxiety.\n\nBenjamini-Hochberg adjustments (q = 0.05 family-wise) do not alter inference because the extremely small p-values remain far below the threshold.\n\n## Robustness and Sensitivity\n- **HYP-001**: Treating childhood class as categorical with Helmert contrasts yields an average class effect of 0.07 (F = 89.7). An ordinal logit specification reports a log-odds coefficient of 0.17 (p approx 7.3e-48), and z-scoring the outcome produces beta = 0.097 (p approx 1.6e-51). All checks retain the positive direction and comparable magnitudes.\n- **HYP-003**: A logistic model contrasting high anxiety agreement (>= 1) produces an odds ratio of 0.57 (95% CI approx [0.51, 0.64]). Binning CSA intensity into 0/1-3/4+ bins and trimming the CSA >15 tail both keep negative associations (beta_bins = -0.33; trimmed beta = -0.48), corroborating the observed direction despite diverging from the preregistered expectation.\n\n## Interpretation and Context\nChildhood class effects appear modest in absolute scale units but align with roughly a tenth of the variability in the self-love measure. Meta-analytic work consistently links childhood sexual abuse to elevated anxiety and related psychopathology (Lindert et al., 2014; Hashim et al., 2024), and symptom network analysis among CSA survivors highlights worry and restlessness as central nodes (Li et al., 2023). The present negative coefficient therefore likely reflects measurement or reporting dynamics rather than a true protective effect. Potential explanations include (1) the agreement scale framing (\"I tend to suffer from anxiety\") eliciting stigma-driven disagreement among trauma survivors, (2) unmeasured treatment uptake reducing current anxiety symptoms despite historical CSA exposure, and (3) sample composition differences relative to clinical and adolescent cohorts emphasized in the literature. Pending follow-up diagnostics (T-016) will probe scale direction and subgroup heterogeneity before drawing substantive conclusions.\n\n## Limitations\n1. Survey provider has not confirmed the absence of design weights; we proceed under a simple random sampling assumption and flag potential bias from undisclosed complex design features.\n2. Both outcomes are ordinal but modeled as interval variables; effect magnitudes should be interpreted as approximate.\n3. CSA exposure is derived from a composite score, and its association with lower anxiety agreement suggests possible measurement or reporting artifacts that merit qualitative follow-up.\n\n## Ethics, Privacy, and Disclosure\n- Small-cell suppression threshold: n < 10 (per `config/agent_config.yaml`); adhere to rounding/binning in all outputs.\n- Data contain sensitive childhood trauma indicators; confirm IRB posture before dissemination.\n\n## Open Questions\n1. Should HYP-004 (social support) advance to confirmatory status once routing documentation is secured?\n2. Does the negative CSA-anxiety association stem from coding (negative vs. positive framing), sample composition, or differential nonresponse requiring additional weighting or qualitative context?\n\n## Reproducibility Notes\n- Environment snapshot: `artifacts/session_info.txt`.\n- Seed: `artifacts/seed.txt` (20251016).\n- Regeneration commands:  \n  - Confirmatory estimates: `python analysis/code/confirmatory_models.py --dataset data/clean/childhoodbalancedpublic_with_csa_indicator.csv --config config/agent_config.yaml --survey-design docs/survey_design.yaml --hypotheses HYP-001 HYP-003 --results-csv analysis/results.csv --overwrite`  \n  - FDR adjustment: `python analysis/code/fdr_adjust.py --results analysis/results.csv --hypotheses analysis/hypotheses.csv --config config/agent_config.yaml --family-scope confirmatory --audit-table tables/fdr_adjustment_confirmatory.csv`  \n  - Robustness checks: `python analysis/code/run_robustness_checks.py --dataset data/clean/childhoodbalancedpublic_with_csa_indicator.csv --config config/agent_config.yaml --qc-dir qc --tables-dir tables/robustness --hypotheses HYP-001 HYP-003`  \n  - Literature queries (respect 120 s throttle to avoid HTTP 429):  \n    `sleep 120 && curl -s 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=childhood%20sexual%20abuse%20anxiety%20adult&limit=3&fields=title,authors,year,venue,url,journal,externalIds' > lit/queries/20251104_semanticscholar_csa_anxiety_adult.json`  \n    `sleep 120 && curl -s 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=childhood%20sexual%20abuse%20anxiety%20depression%20network%20analysis&limit=1&fields=title,authors,year,venue,url,journal,externalIds,abstract' > lit/queries/20251104_semanticscholar_csa_anxiety_network.json`\n- Manual edits remain synchronized with `papers/main/manuscript.tex`; document any automated regeneration (e.g., via pandoc) in `papers/main/MANIFEST.md`.\n",

All estimates rely on HC3 OLS under a simple random sampling assumption and are reproducible with seed 20251016.\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Data: \\texttt{data/raw/childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv} (checksums recorded in \\texttt{artifacts/checksums.json}).\n  \\item Derived dataset: Generated via \\texttt{analysis/code/derive_csa_indicator.py} using seed 20251016.\n  \\item Confirmatory scope: Hypotheses HYP-001 and HYP-003 as defined in the frozen PAP (\\texttt{analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md}).\n  \\item Statistical plan: HC3 OLS under simple random sampling; Benjamini--Hochberg FDR at $q=0.05$ within the confirmatory family.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\textbf{HYP-001 (Wellbeing family):} Childhood class exhibits a positive association with adult self-love ($\\beta = 0.181$, $\\mathrm{SE} = 0.012$; 95\\% CI [0.158, 0.205]; $q = 3.9\\times 10^{-51}$). Relative to the outcome's standard deviation (1.86), the estimate equals approximately $0.10\\sigma$ and implies a $\\sim0.5$-point difference when comparing respondents three class steps apart, holding age, gender, and cis identity constant.\n  \\item \\textbf{HYP-003 (MentalHealth family):} Any CSA exposure is linked to $-0.491$ points on the anxiety agreement scale ($\\mathrm{SE} = 0.037$; 95\\% CI [$-0.562$, $-0.419$]; $q = 6.9\\times 10^{-41}$). Because the negative-coded outcome maps higher agreement to positive values, the negative coefficient means CSA-exposed respondents report lower agreement with the statement ``I tend to suffer from anxiety,'' opposite to the preregistered expectation of higher anxiety; the magnitude is approximately $0.24\\sigma$.\n\\end{itemize}\nBenjamini--Hochberg adjustments at $q = 0.05$ do not alter inference because the extremely small p-values remain far below the threshold.\n\n\\section{Robustness and Sensitivity}\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\textbf{HYP-001:} Treating childhood class as categorical with Helmert contrasts yields an average class effect of 0.07 ($F = 89.7$). An ordinal logit specification reports a log-odds coefficient of 0.17 ($p \\approx 7.3\\times 10^{-48}$), and z-scoring the outcome produces $\\beta = 0.097$ ($p \\approx 1.6\\times 10^{-51}$). All checks retain the positive direction and comparable magnitudes.\n  \\item \\textbf{HYP-003:} A logistic model contrasting high anxiety agreement (score $\\geq 1$) produces an odds ratio of 0.57 (95\\% CI $\\approx$ [0.51, 0.64]). Binning CSA intensity into 0/1--3/4+ bins and trimming the CSA $>15$ tail both keep negative associations ($\\beta_{\\text{bins}} = -0.33$; trimmed $\\beta = -0.48$), corroborating the observed direction despite diverging from the preregistered expectation.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Interpretation and Context}\nChildhood class effects appear modest in absolute scale units but align with roughly a tenth of the variability in the self-love measure. Meta-analytic syntheses report consistently higher anxiety prevalence among childhood sexual abuse survivors (e.g., Lindert et al., 2014; Hashim et al., 2024), and symptom network analysis highlights worry and restlessness as central among exposed youth (Li et al., 2023). The present negative coefficient therefore likely reflects measurement or reporting dynamics rather than a true protective effect. Potential explanations include (1) the agreement framing (``I tend to suffer from anxiety'') prompting stigma-driven disagreement among trauma survivors, (2) unmeasured treatment uptake reducing current anxiety despite historical CSA exposure, and (3) sample composition differences relative to the adolescent and clinical cohorts emphasized in published studies. Pending diagnostics (Task T-016) will probe scale direction and subgroup heterogeneity before drawing substantive conclusions.\n\n\\section{Limitations}\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Sampling weights remain unavailable; analyses rely on the simple random sampling assumption and may inherit bias from undisclosed complex design features.\n  \\item Outcomes are ordinal but modeled as interval; effect magnitudes should be interpreted as approximate tendencies.\n  \\item The CSA indicator is derived from a composite score, and its association with lower anxiety agreement suggests possible measurement or reporting artifacts that require qualitative follow-up.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Ethics and Privacy}\nEnforce small-cell suppression for counts below 10 and review IRB/licensing requirements before dissemination.\n\n\\section{Open Questions}\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Evaluate readiness of the social support hypothesis (HYP-004) for future PAP inclusion.\n  \\item Determine whether the negative CSA--anxiety association stems from coding (negative vs.\\ positive framing), sample composition, or differential nonresponse requiring weighting or qualitative context.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Reproducibility Notes}\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Environment snapshot: \\texttt{artifacts/session_info.txt}; seed recorded in \\texttt{artifacts/seed.txt} (20251016).\n  \\item Confirmatory estimates: \\texttt{python analysis/code/confirmatory_models.py --dataset data/clean/childhoodbalancedpublic_with_csa_indicator.csv --config config/agent_config.yaml --survey-design docs/survey_design.yaml --hypotheses HYP-001 HYP-003 --results-csv analysis/results.csv --overwrite}\n  \\item FDR adjustment: \\texttt{python analysis/code/fdr_adjust.py --results analysis/results.csv --hypotheses analysis/hypotheses.csv --config config/agent_config.yaml --family-scope confirmatory --audit-table tables/fdr_adjustment_confirmatory.csv}\n  \\item Robustness checks: \\texttt{python analysis/code/run_robustness_checks.py --dataset data/clean/childhoodbalancedpublic_with_csa_indicator.csv --config config/agent_config.yaml --qc-dir qc --tables-dir tables/robustness --hypotheses HYP-001 HYP-003}\n  \\item Literature queries (wait 120 seconds to avoid HTTP 429):\n  \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\texttt{sleep 120 && curl -s 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=childhood sexual abuse anxiety adult\\&limit=3\\&fields=title,authors,year,venue,url,journal,externalIds' > lit/queries/20251104_semanticscholar_csa_anxiety_adult.json}\n    \\item \\texttt{sleep 120 && curl -s 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=childhood sexual abuse anxiety depression network analysis\\&limit=1\\&fields=title,authors,year,venue,url,journal,externalIds,abstract' > lit/queries/20251104_semanticscholar_csa_anxiety_network.json}\n  \\end{itemize}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\end{document}\n",

HYP-003 consistently showed a negative CSA association (logit OR=0.57, 95% CI approx [0.51, 0.64]), contradicting the preregistered direction. Outputs recorded in `tables/robustness/robustness_checks_summary.{csv,json}` with QC notes under `qc/`.\n\n2025-11-04T10:35Z (Synthesis) \u2014 Drafted confirmatory narrative describing magnitudes, interpretability, and robustness for HYP-001/HYP-003.
