HYP-001,Wellbeing,"Childhood class positively relates to adult self-love.",I love myself (2l8994l),classchild,"selfage; gendermale","Non-missing classchild & outcome","Weighted mean change per class unit",selected,"Primary model: survey OLS (HC3). Robustness: (1) treat classchild as categorical with Helmert contrasts; (2) ordinal logit with proportional odds check; (3) re-center outcome to z-score for scale sensitivity."
HYP-002,MentalHealth,"Current class inversely relates to depression agreement.",I tend to suffer from depression (wz901dj),classcurrent,"selfage; gendermale; cis","Non-missing classcurrent & outcome","Weighted coefficient on classcurrent",proposed,"Spline robustness."
HYP-003,MentalHealth,"CSA exposure associates with higher anxiety agreement.",I tend to suffer from anxiety (npvfh98)-neg,CSA_score_indicator,"selfage; gendermale","Observed CSA_score","Weighted mean difference (CSA>0 vs 0)",selected,"CSA_score_indicator derived via analysis/code/derive_csa_indicator.py (CSA_score>0). Robustness: (1) logistic regression (logit) on indicator vs linear probability; (2) replace indicator with 3-level ordinal bins (0, 1-3, 4+); (3) exclude high-exposure tail (CSA>15) to test leverage."
HYP-004,SocialSupport,"Supportive circles associate with higher self-love.",I love myself (2l8994l),"In general, people in my *current* social circles tend treat me really well (tmt46e6)","selfage; gendermale","Non-missing support & outcome","Weighted coefficient on support",proposed,"Ordinal logit robustness."
