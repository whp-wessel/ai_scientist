Run exploratory weighted summaries for religion and happiness variables.\n2. Document QA checks and sync findings with `manuscript.tex`.\n3. Monitor sponsor communications for survey design metadata updates.\n\n> Update this notebook after each analysis loop with commands run, seeds used, and outputs generated.\n\n## Loop 1 - Survey Design Validation\n\n- **Commands:**  \n  - `python scripts/design_scan.py --csv childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv`  \n  - `python - <<'PY'` (counts rows; see `qc/design_validation.md`)\n- **Seed:** 20251016 (inherited; no stochastic procedures invoked).\n- **Outcome:** No survey weight, strata, cluster, or replicate columns detected. Updated `docs/survey_design.yaml`, `config/agent_config.yaml`, and `qc/data_checks.md`; recorded findings in `qc/design_validation.md`.\n\n## Loop 2 - Exploratory Summaries for Key Outcomes\n\n- **Commands:**  \n  - `python scripts/exploratory_summaries.py --csv childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv --config config/agent_config.yaml --out tables/summary_key_outcomes.csv`\n- **Seed:** 20251016 (deterministic computation; no stochastic elements beyond fixed seed).\n- **Outputs:** `tables/summary_key_outcomes.csv`, `tables/summary_key_outcomes.json`\n- **Notes:** Generated unweighted descriptive statistics for priority outcomes because calibrated survey weights remain unavailable. All reported cells meet the minimum count threshold (>=10) enforced within the script.\n\n## Loop 3 - Sponsor Design Metadata Monitoring\n\n- **Commands:**  \n  - `python scripts/design_scan.py --csv childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv`\n- **Seed:** 20251016 (deterministic scan; no randomness invoked).\n- **Outcome:** Confirmed no new sponsor-provided survey design metadata files. Script matches only questionnaire columns containing \"weight\" or \"jk\" substrings; none correspond to calibrated weights or replicate designs. See `qc/design_metadata_monitor.md` for details.\n\n## Loop 6 - H1 Religion by Sex Estimates\n\n- **Commands:**  \n  - `python scripts/analyze_h1_religion_by_biomale.py --csv childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv --config config/agent_config.yaml --design docs/survey_design.yaml --out tables/h1_religion_by_biomale.csv --diff-out tables/h1_religion_by_biomale_diff.csv --manifest artifacts/h1_religion_by_biomale_manifest.json`\n- **Seed:** 20251016 (set via config; analysis deterministic under SRS assumption).\n- **Outputs:** `tables/h1_religion_by_biomale.csv`, `tables/h1_religion_by_biomale_diff.csv`, `artifacts/h1_religion_by_biomale_manifest.json`.\n- **Notes:** Recast `religion` responses into an \"any practice\" indicator (`religion > 0`). The SRS-based estimate indicates non-male respondents practice religion at a higher rate than male respondents (difference ≈ -0.058, 95% CI [-0.074, -0.043]). All subgroup counts exceed the privacy threshold (>=10).\n\n## Loop 7 - H2 Religion Strictness vs Happiness\n\n- **Commands:**  \n  - `python scripts/analyze_h2_religion_strictness_vs_happiness.py --csv childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv --config config/agent_config.yaml --design docs/survey_design.yaml --out tables/h2_happiness_by_religion_strictness.csv --diff-out tables/h2_happiness_by_religion_strictness_diff.csv --manifest artifacts/h2_religion_strictness_vs_happiness_manifest.json`\n- **Seed:** 20251016 (deterministic SRS means; no additional randomness).\n- **Outputs:** `tables/h2_happiness_by_religion_strictness.csv`, `tables/h2_happiness_by_religion_strictness_diff.csv`, `artifacts/h2_religion_strictness_vs_happiness_manifest.json`.\n- **Notes:** Ordinal `externalreligion` values were partitioned into terciles (0 | 1-2 | 3-4) using deterministic cumulative counts. Mean adult-vs-childhood happiness scores rise from Tercile 2 to Tercile 3 (difference ≈ 0.144, Bonferroni-adjusted 95% CI [0.043, 0.244]) while Tercile 1 exceeds Tercile 2 by ≈0.104 in the negative direction. All reported cells satisfy the minimum n ≥ 10 privacy guardrail.\n\n## Loop 8 - Manuscript and Reporting Updates\n\n- **Commands:** Documentation updates only; no analytical scripts executed. All referenced results derive from loops 6 and 7 (seed 20251016).\n- **Outputs:** `reports/findings_summary.md`, `reports/manuscript.md`, `manuscript.tex` (synchronized content).\n- **Notes:** Summarized design context (SRS assumption) and integrated H1/H2 findings into both Markdown and LaTeX manuscripts. Recorded regeneration commands alongside each result and checked privacy thresholds (all n ≥ 10). No data transformations or reruns required; relied on previously generated tables in `tables/` and manifests in `artifacts/`.\n", "mode": "text"},
