      "abstract_excerpt": "Background: Food insecurity is associated with adverse cardiometabolic health in adults. To understand the early, long-term impact of food insecurity, we examined the associations of food insecurity in childhood with young adult cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome stage and suboptimal cardiovascular health (CVH), and the modifying effects of participation during childhood in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Methods: In the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study of individuals enrolled at birth (1998-2000) and followed through age 22 years (2020-24) across 20 US cities, the associations of household food insecurity during childhood (age 3-5 years; score \u2265\u2026"

Prevalence of childhood asthma in the United States is 5.8%. In boys, prevalence is 5.7% and it is 6% in girls. Asthma is associated with other comorbidities such as major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder. This study explores the association between asthma and depression. Methods: we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study using NHANES data from 2013 to 2018. Asthma and childhood onset asthma were assessed using questionnaires MCQ010 and MCQ025, respectively. Sociodemographic variables were summarized, and univ\u2026"

However, the potential pathways from childhood residential green space to adulthood mental wellbeing are not well understood. Therefore, we conducted a questionnaire survey among Chinese adults (N = 770) in September 2021 to capture data on subjective measures of residential green space and nature contact during childhood, and nature connectedness, nature contact, and mental wellbeing during adulthood. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to examine theoretical pathways between childhood residential green space and a\u2026"

This study focuses on exploring the relationship between childhood socioeconomic status, hope, sense of control, and adult subjective wellbeing using a structural equation model. Results indicated that hope and sense of control mediated the links between childhood socioeconomic status and adult subjective wellbeing, revealing that hope and sense of control may buffer the negative impacts of childhood poverty experiences on subjective wellbeing. The findings provide new insights into the impacts of chil\u2026"
