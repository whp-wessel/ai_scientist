It\nremains a **draft** until (a) survey design metadata are verified or explicitly\nassumed SRS, (b) the literature gate (>=3 DOI-backed citations) is satisfied, (c)\n`qc/measures_validity.md` contains entries for every referenced variable with\nreliability evidence, and (d) the PAP is registered + tagged. When frozen, this\nheader will read `status: frozen (commit <sha>, tag pap-v1)` and all\nconfirmatory work will cite that commit/tag.\n\n## 1. Data, Design, and Determinism\n- **Dataset**: `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` (14,443 x 718). Raw file is\n  immutable; cleaning scripts will write to `data/clean/`.\n- **Survey design**: Treated as SRS until Task T-001 resolves whether weights,\n  strata, or replicate design files exist. Any newly discovered design vars must\n  be added to `docs/survey_design.yaml` and reflected in all estimators before a\n  PAP freeze.\n- **Seed discipline**: Global seed `20251016` (from `config/agent_config.yaml`).\n  All randomized operations (e.g., multiple imputation) will explicitly set this\n  seed and log it inside the resulting tables/figures manifests.\n- **Regeneration command** (draft skeleton):\n  ```bash\n  python analysis/code/00_run_all.py \\\n    --seed 20251016 \\\n    --pap analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md \\\n    --raw childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv\n  ```\n  Scripts referenced above will orchestrate cleaning (`analysis/code/01_prepare_data.py`)\n  and estimation (`analysis/code/02_models.py`). Hashes + command strings will be\n  recorded in `papers/main/MANIFEST.md` once implemented.\n- **LaTeX parity plan**: Every time the Markdown manuscript or PAP changes,\n  `papers/main/manuscript.tex` will be regenerated via `latexmk -pdf` and logged in\n  `papers/main/build_log.txt`. The PAP references that build log as evidence of parity.\n\n## 2. Priority Hypotheses (Confirmatory Candidates)\n\n### H1 — Wellbeing (Claim C1)\n- **Question**: Do respondents from higher childhood socioeconomic classes\n  (`classchild`) report being happier as adults relative to childhood (`h33e6gg`)?\n- **Estimand**: Difference in weighted mean Likert score between respondents with\n  `classchild >= 4` (upper/upper-middle) and `classchild <= 2` (lower/lower-middle).\n  Sensitivity: ordinal logit slope treating `classchild` as an ordered predictor.\n- **Model**: Survey-weighted linear regression (or SRS OLS with HC2 SEs if weights\n  remain unavailable). Include controls `selfage`, `gendermale`, and indicator for\n  `networth` >= sample median. Secondary model: proportional-odds regression.\n- **Missing data**: If any covariate has >5% missingness, deploy multiple\n  imputation by chained equations (m=20, burn-in 10) seeded at 20251016. Record\n  pooled estimates and Rubin's rules SEs.\n- **Robustness checks**:\n  1. Treat `classchild` as z-scored continuous predictor (trend test).\n  2. Estimate models separately for `gendermale==1` vs `gendermale==0` and report\n     qualitative heterogeneity (no interaction term in primary estimand).\n\n### H2 — Adversity (Claim C2)\n- **Question**: Is childhood verbal/emotional abuse (`mds78zu`) associated with\n  higher likelihood of reporting adult depression (`wz901dj`)?\n- **Estimand**: Difference in probability of selecting Likert levels >=4 between\n  exposed vs non-exposed respondents.\n- **Model**: Survey-weighted logistic regression on indicator(`wz901dj >= 4`)\n  with controls `selfage`, `gendermale`, `classchild`, and `education`.\n- **Missing data**: Sensitive trauma items may exceed 10% missingness. If so,\n  implement MI (m=20, seed 20251016) with predictive mean matching for Likert\n  outcomes. Retain a missingness flag in robustness tables to document MAR\n  assumptions.\n- **Negative-control outcome**: Repeat the model with `height` (continuous) as\n  the outcome—association should be null. Non-null effects will trigger a PAP\n  revision before freeze.\n- **Secondary robustness**: Replace exposure with adolescent abuse item (if\n  present) to ensure age-window consistency.\n\n### H3/H4 — Proposed (Not Yet in PAP)\n- H3 (economic): Evaluate whether childhood SES predicts current net worth after\n  adjusting for education; candidate for future PAP inclusion once mediation plan\n  is articulated.\n- H4 (psychosocial): Explore anxiety-happiness coupling to inform composite\n  wellbeing indices; remains exploratory until measurement validity completed.\n\n## 3. Measurement Validity & QC Tasks\n- Populate `qc/measures_validity.md` with Cronbach's alpha (or test-retest\n  metrics) for `h33e6gg`, `npvfh98`, `wz901dj`, `classchild`, `mds78zu`, and\n  `networth`. Include DIF checks across `gendermale` for each Likert scale.\n- `qc/data_checks.md` will continue to log schema validation, dtype coercions,\n  and missingness summaries. Any deviations must be mirrored in the Decision Log.\n\n## 4. Privacy & Disclosure Controls\n- Small-cell threshold: 10 respondents. Every public table/figure must log its\n  minimum cell count in `qc/disclosure_check_loop_000.md` before circulation.\n- Trauma variables (e.g., `mds78zu`) will be reported only in aggregate; hex-binned\n  plots preferred over raw scatter to avoid re-identification.\n\n## 5. Literature & Documentation Requirements\n- Maintain `lit/evidence_map.csv` with `claim_id` coverage; each claim cited in\n  future manuscripts must map to >=1 DOI-backed entry.\n- Append Semantic Scholar query metadata under `lit/queries/loop_{loop}/` for\n  every search (already satisfied for loop 000).\n- Update `lit/bibliography.bib` alongside the evidence map; run `bibtex` during\n  manuscript builds and log warnings in `papers/main/build_log.txt`.\n\n## 6. Outstanding Items Blocking Freeze\n1. Verify survey design weights/replicates or formally document SRS assumption.\n2. Produce at least three DOI-backed literature entries linked to Claim IDs.\n3. Complete `qc/measures_validity.md` for all PAP-referenced variables.\n4. Implement the scripted regeneration pathway and populate MANIFEST commands.\n\nConfirmatory analyses will **not** begin until the above blockers are removed and\nthis PAP is marked frozen with a registry URL plus commit SHA/tag reference.\n",

Data Sanity + Reproducibility Hooks\n- Confirmed dataset shape and column availability via:\n  ```bash\n  python - <<'PY'\n  import pandas as pd\n  df = pd.read_csv('childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv')\n  print({'rows': len(df), 'cols': df.shape[1]})\n  print(df.columns[:10].tolist())\n  PY\n  ```\n  DtypeWarning (mixed types in column 68) logged for remediation in cleaning script.\n- `qc/data_checks.md` updated with the command above, PII scan notes, and the plan\n  to codify checks inside `analysis/scripts/data_checks.py`.\n- Reaffirmed seed 20251016; all future scripts will accept `--seed` and write it\n  into manifests.\n\n### 2. Hypothesis Ideation (Descriptive/Associational)\n- **H1 (C1, wellbeing family):** Upper childhood SES (classchild>=4) linked to higher\n  adult happiness vs childhood (h33e6gg). Priority for PAP.\n- **H2 (C2, adversity family):** Childhood verbal/emotional abuse (mds78zu) increases\n  likelihood of adult depression (wz901dj). Priority for PAP with negative-control\n  outcome requirement.\n- **H3 (C3, economic family):** Childhood SES predicts adult net worth (networth)\n  after adjusting for education.\n- **H4 (C4, psychosocial family):** Higher anxiety (npvfh98) aligns with lower adult\n  happiness relative to childhood.\n  These hypotheses are now recorded in `analysis/hypotheses.csv` with status tags.\n\n### 3. PAP Drafting + LaTeX Alignment Plan\n- `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md` refreshed (status: draft) with detailed estimands,\n  missingness/imputation approach, robustness checks, and explicit regeneration\n  commands. It reiterates that LaTeX parity will be tracked via\n  `papers/main/build_log.txt` once manuscript drafting begins.\n- Blockers before freeze: survey design verification, literature coverage (>=3 DOI\n  sources for claim IDs), measurement validity table, and scripted pipeline.\n\n### 4. Literature Scoping (Semantic Scholar)\n- Query executed via Python `urllib`:\n  `graph/v1/paper/search?query=childhood+nutrition+adult+wellbeing+survey&limit=5&fields=title,year,venue,externalIds,url,openAccessPdf,authors,citationCount,abstract`\n- Response stored at `lit/queries/loop_000/query_001.json` with timestamp and full\n  payload. No rate-limit issues.\n- Extracted three immediately relevant sources:\n  1. Lam et al. (2024) on childhood food security and cardiometabolic health.\n  2. Liu et al. (2022) on childhood green space and adult mental wellbeing.\n  3. Li et al. (2022) on childhood SES influencing adult wellbeing via hope/control.\n  Bibliography + evidence map now reference these DOIs with rationale scores.\n\n### 5. Next Steps\n1. **T-001:** Confirm survey weight/replicate availability or lock in SRS assumption.\n2. **T-002:** Produce exploratory weighted (or SRS) summaries for wellbeing and\n   adversity outcomes, labeling them \"Exploratory\" in notebooks/tables.\n3. **T-003:** Extend literature sweep to cover mediators (parental support, hope)\n   and begin drafting `qc/measures_validity.md`.\n",

Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to examine theoretical pathways between childhood residential green space and a\\u2026\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"paperId\": \"dd10246c609ca8a7afa847abd00c269899f14fb9\",\n      \"title\": \"Childhood Socioeconomic Status and Adult Subjective Wellbeing: The Role of Hope and Sense of Control\",\n      \"year\": 2022,\n      \"venue\": \"Frontiers in Psychology\",\n      \"doi\": \"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.879132\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd10246c609ca8a7afa847abd00c269899f14fb9\",\n      \"citationCount\": 8,\n      \"authors\": [\n        \"Li Wang\",\n        \"Fenglan Li\",\n        \"Keqiang Meng\",\n        \"K.

Results indicated that hope and sense of control mediated the links between childhood socioeconomic status and adult subjective wellbeing, revealing that hope and sense of control may buffer the negative impacts of childhood poverty experiences on subjective wellbeing.
