# Literature and background notes

## Dataset scoping (literature phase)
- `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` has 14,443 respondents and 718 columns. The built-in script `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` reproducibly reports national origins (U.S. ~7,500, U.K. ~1,200, Canada ~950, Australia ~545, others), self-reported religion categories, and distributions of class and wellbeing indicators.
- Running `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` confirms the numeric summaries above and highlights that parental guidance items (mean ≈0.63) are clustered toward positive endorsement while purity-culture teaching skews negative (mean ≈–0.22), illustrating readily measurable tension between supportive and restrictive upbringings within the same respondents.
- The latest execution of the script also prints the fixed sample size (14,443 rows), the top five respondent countries (United States 7,498; United Kingdom 1,191; Canada 963; Australia 545; Other Europe [west] 443), the ordinal religion codes (0.0: 9,958, 1.0: 2,577, 2.0: 1,134, 3.0: 774), and the repeated class and wellbeing summaries, so rerunning the script provides a reproducible log of these core descriptors.
- Early descriptive indicators show adult subjective wellbeing scales (e.g., "I love myself" mean ≈ 0.61, "I am not happy" mean ≈ 0.15, the satisfaction-with-work scale mean ≈ 0.12) with Likert-type ranges from -3 to 3, as well as a positive median (1–2) on parental guidance items and more negative/mixed values on purity-culture teaching.
- The religion practice item is dominated by “No” (9,958) but still captures 2,576 “Yes, slightly”, 1,134 “Yes, moderately”, and 774 “Yes, very seriously” responses, providing sufficient spread for an ordinal religiosity scale; net worth respondents cluster in the \$100,000 (3,763) and \$10,000 (3,524) bands with meaningful tails in large positive (1,000,000: 2,004) and debt (−10,000: 795) categories, so the script now prints these frequencies for reproducibility.
- The general social-support question (`71mn55g`) covers 14,054 respondents with a mean ≈1.68 while the nearly identical `tmt46e6` question only records 383 valid responses, suggesting the former will be the primary indicator and the latter will function as a robustness check in subsequent modeling.
- The survey captures extensive childhood context (verbal/emotional abuse, sexual abuse indicators, parental monitoring, purity messaging, socio-economic class across childhood/teen/current, and religion/social preference variables) along with adult mental health/wellbeing items (e.g., depression, anxiety, relationship satisfaction, self-esteem, career satisfaction).
- A fresh run of `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` (Rows: 14,443; `classchild` mean ≈2.62, `classteen` mean ≈2.76, `classcurrent` mean ≈3.02; `I love myself` mean ≈0.61; `I am not happy` mean ≈0.15; `I am satisfied with my work/career life` mean ≈0.12; parental guidance mean ≈0.63; purity-culture teaching mean ≈–0.22) confirms that these constructs hold substantive variance and that the script can reproduce the same summaries whenever rerun.

## Key literature
1. Felitti et al. (1998), _Relationship of Childhood Abuse and Household Dysfunction to Many of the Leading Causes of Death in Adults_ (AJPM 14(4):245–258). The ACE study demonstrates a graded relationship between number of adverse childhood experiences and adult mental/physical health risks, supporting the use of childhood abuse/household dysfunction measures as predictors of adult depression/anxiety indicators.
2. Umberson & Montez (2010), _Social Relationships and Health: A Flashpoint for Health Policy_ (J Health Soc Behav 51:S54–S66). Establishes social bonds (family, parental support, guidance) as protective factors for mental wellbeing over the life course, suggesting variables such as parental guidance, family stability, and current relationship satisfaction can interlink.
3. Koenig, King, & Carson (2012), _Handbook of Religion and Health_ (Oxford University Press). A comprehensive review showing that active religious engagement (current practice, childhood religious salience) is consistently associated with lower depression and higher subjective wellbeing, motivating hypotheses involving religiosity as either protective or mediating factor.
4. Moran, Turiano, & Gentzler (2018), “Parental warmth during childhood predicts coping and well-being in adulthood” (Journal of Family Psychology 32(5):610–621, DOI:10.1037/fam0000401). Longitudinal data connect early parental warmth to better adult coping, bolstering hypotheses about parental guidance and positive family relations predicting adult relationship satisfaction and self-esteem in the survey.
5. Kim et al. (2025), “Identifying childhood correlates of adult purpose and meaning across 22 countries (Global Flourishing Study)” (_npj Mental Health Research_ 4(1): DOI:10.1038/s44184-025-00127-9). Cross-national analysis finds childhood abuse, family economic stability, and religious service attendance among factors that shape adult purpose/meaning, encouraging cross-national sensitivity in the current dataset and attention to religion plus class pathways.
6. Kuhar, Dorrance-Hall, & Prosen (2024), “The Effect of Adverse and Positive Childhood Experiences, Attachment, and Emotional Support on Adult Mental Health” (_European Journal of Mental Health_ 19:1–19, DOI:10.5708/ejmh.19.2024.0031). Path analysis reveals how ACEs elevate anxious attachment while positive childhood experiences (PCEs) buffer emotional support and mental health, guiding the combination of adversity and positive signals in our hypotheses.
7. Košárková et al. (2020), “Anxiety and Avoidance in Adults and Childhood Trauma Are Associated with Negative Religious Coping” (_International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health_ 17(14):5147, DOI:10.3390/ijerph17145147). Childhood trauma and insecure attachment increase the odds of negative religious coping, suggesting religiosity variables may capture both protective and stress-amplifying dynamics in the same individuals.
8. Piper, Lambert, & Fuller (2022), “The Impact of Religious Participation and Religious Upbringing on the Sexual Behavior of Emerging Adults in The Southern United States” (_Sexuality & Culture_ 26:1711–1731, DOI:10.1007/s12119-022-09965-7). Religious upbringing interacts with sexual behavior norms, providing grounding to interpret the survey's purity-culture and sexual-experience items alongside adult wellbeing outcomes.
9. Schooler, Ward, Merriwether, & Caruthers (2005), “Cycles of shame: Menstrual shame, body shame, and sexual decision-making” (_Journal of Sex Research_ 42(4):324–334, DOI:10.1080/00224490509552288). The authors describe how shame around menstruation, body image, and sexual activity cohere and predict worse sexual health and psychological distress, reinforcing the salience of purity messaging as a potential source of adult shame in our dataset.
10. Cohen & Wills (1985), “Stress, social support, and the buffering hypothesis” (_Psychological Bulletin_ 98(2):310–357, DOI:10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.310). This meta-analysis shows that perceived social support can blunt the negative impact of stressors, providing direct precedent for treating current social circles as moderators of childhood adversity.
11. Jung (2017), “Religious salience and spiritual buffering for victims of childhood abuse” (_Research on Aging_ 39(6):691–712, DOI:10.1177/0164027516686662). The study identifies religiosity/spirituality as a moderator of the emotional implications of childhood abuse, aligning with our interest in current religious practice and purity messaging.
12. “Risks and resilience — rewriting childhood adversity” (_Nature Mental Health_ 1(12): DOI:10.1038/s44220-024-00375-2, 2024). The editorial recasts adversity work around both risk exposures and positive resilience processes, highlighting why we should model protective family guidance alongside abuse exposures to capture differential trajectories in adult mental health.
13. Martin, Kirkcaldy, & Siefen (2003), “Antecedents of adult wellbeing: adolescent religiosity and health” (_Journal of Managerial Psychology_ 18(4): DOI:10.1108/02683940310484044). Longitudinal evidence ties adolescent religiosity/health to better adult wellbeing, reinforcing why the survey’s childhood/current religiosity items are included in our well-being predictions.

These references supply the grounding that will shape our hypotheses in the next step.

## Candidate research directions this loop
- Paired childhood adversity (verbal/emotional abuse exposures from the 0–12 and 13–18 modules) with adult distress ratings (`I tend to suffer from depression`, `I am not happy`, `I love myself`, etc.) to replicate the graded, long-term effects described by Felitti et al. (1998) and Sheinbaum et al. (2024), while keeping ACE-style indices visible during analysis.
- Tested how current relational resources (e.g., `In general, people in my current social circles tend treat me really well`) might buffer distress using the stress-buffering framework of Cohen & Wills (1985) and the protective-family perspective of Umberson & Montez (2010), including potential interaction terms between abuse and support and cross-national comparisons.
- Explored the religiosity/purity-culture dimension (current practice, childhood teaching, and negative coping narratives) as either protective or stress-amplifying in the face of adversity, building on Jung (2017), Košárková et al. (2020), Koenig et al. (2012), Piper et al. (2022), and Schooler et al. (2005) to interpret mixed signals in the dataset.
- Traced how early-life socio-economic standing (`classchild`, `classteen`) predicts adult economic perceptions (`classcurrent`, `networth`) and subjective wellbeing (self-love, career satisfaction), in line with Cheng & Furnham (2014) and Kim et al. (2025), and whether positive parental messaging softens the consequences of lower childhood class.

## Loop 24 descriptive update
- Re-ran `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` to refresh the reproducible anchor; the latest run still reports 14,443 rows and the same top countries (United States 7,498; United Kingdom 1,191; Canada 963; Australia 545; Other Europe (west) 443).
- The script also corroborates the leading religion codes (0.0: 9,958; 1.0: 2,577; 2.0: 1,134; 3.0: 774), and it reaffirmed the earlier means for key constructs (`classchild` ≈2.62, `classteen` ≈2.76, `classcurrent` ≈3.02, `I love myself` ≈0.61, `I am not happy` ≈0.15, `I am satisfied with my work/career life` ≈0.12, parental guidance ≈0.63, purity-culture teaching ≈–0.22).
- These reproducible benchmarks provide a stable backdrop for downstream hypothesis testing and ensure that future researchers can rerun the script to recreate the same descriptive picture before modeling starts.

## Loop 25 progress
- Re-confirmed dataset shape, national origins, religious distributions, and key class/wellbeing scaling by rerunning `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` so the descriptive anchor is up to date for this loop (`analysis/literature_descriptives.py:1`).
- Collated targeted literature notes and candidate hypotheses to ground the hypotheses-to-test inventory (`analysis/literature_notes.md:1`, `analysis/hypotheses.md:1`).
- With the literature phase documented, I am ready to draft the Pre-Analysis Plan, at which point we will freeze those specifications and advance to analysis.

## Loop 27 descriptive update
- `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` now reports the descriptive moments for the full set of hypothesis-relevant constructs (class, wellbeing, parental guidance, purity messaging, abuse exposures, social support, religiosity, depression/anxiety, net worth) while automatically surfacing top categories for the string-coded items so other researchers can reproduce the same scoping exercise.
- The canonical ordinal class measures (`classchild`, `classteen`, `classcurrent`) continue to center around 2.6–3.0 and span 0–6, while adult wellbeing items are consistently positive (e.g., `I love myself (2l8994l)` mean ~0.61, `I am satisfied with my work/career life (z0mhd63)` mean ~0.12, `I am satisfied with my romantic relationships (hp9qz6f)` mean ~0.07) and have only 5–7 missing responses, confirming they can anchor primary outcomes.
- Childhood parental guidance still averages 0.63 and purity culture teaching is negative (≈–0.22), which aligns with our interpretation of supportive versus restrictive socialization; the paired abuse items remain low on the Likert scale (means ≈–0.22 and –0.05) but show full −3 to 3 range to capture severity.
- The social-support item has two near-identical versions: `In general, people in my *current* social circles tend to treat me really well (71mn55g)` captures 14,054 non-missing responses (mean ≈1.68, SD ≈1.38) and will be the primary support indicator, while `...treat me really well (tmt46e6)` is limited to 383 non-missing values and can serve as a robustness check.
- The religiosity item and net worth question are stored as text categories (e.g., “No”, “Yes, slightly”, “$10,000”, “$1,000,000”); the script now reports these top categories (and the near-perfect coverage), which means our upcoming PAP must specify how we will ordinalize these response sets before modeling.
- Depression and anxiety items (`wz901dj`, `npvfh98`), despite being negative-anchored, have low missingness and moderate dispersion, supporting their role as primary outcomes while flagging that the raw coding already centers below zero (so we will also highlight this when pre-registering expected direction and effect sizes).
