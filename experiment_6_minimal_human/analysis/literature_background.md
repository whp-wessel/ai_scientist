# Literature and background notes

## Dataset scoping (literature phase)
- `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` has 14,443 respondents and 718 columns. The built-in script `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` reproducibly reports national origins (U.S. ~7,500, U.K. ~1,200, Canada ~950, Australia ~545, others), self-reported religion categories, and distributions of class and wellbeing indicators.
- Running `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` confirms the numeric summaries above and highlights that parental guidance items (mean ≈0.63) are clustered toward positive endorsement while purity-culture teaching skews negative (mean ≈–0.22), illustrating readily measurable tension between supportive and restrictive upbringings within the same respondents.
- Early descriptive indicators show adult subjective wellbeing scales (e.g., "I love myself" mean ≈ 0.61, "I am not happy" mean ≈ 0.15, the satisfaction-with-work scale mean ≈ 0.12) with Likert-type ranges from -3 to 3, as well as a positive median (1–2) on parental guidance items and more negative/mixed values on purity-culture teaching.
- The survey captures extensive childhood context (verbal/emotional abuse, sexual abuse indicators, parental monitoring, purity messaging, socio-economic class across childhood/teen/current, and religion/social preference variables) along with adult mental health/wellbeing items (e.g., depression, anxiety, relationship satisfaction, self-esteem, career satisfaction).

## Key literature
1. Felitti et al. (1998), _Relationship of Childhood Abuse and Household Dysfunction to Many of the Leading Causes of Death in Adults_ (AJPM 14(4):245–258). The ACE study demonstrates a graded relationship between number of adverse childhood experiences and adult mental/physical health risks, supporting the use of childhood abuse/household dysfunction measures as predictors of adult depression/anxiety indicators.
2. Umberson & Montez (2010), _Social Relationships and Health: A Flashpoint for Health Policy_ (J Health Soc Behav 51:S54–S66). Establishes social bonds (family, parental support, guidance) as protective factors for mental wellbeing over the life course, suggesting variables such as parental guidance, family stability, and current relationship satisfaction can interlink.
3. Koenig, King, & Carson (2012), _Handbook of Religion and Health_ (Oxford University Press). A comprehensive review showing that active religious engagement (current practice, childhood religious salience) is consistently associated with lower depression and higher subjective wellbeing, motivating hypotheses involving religiosity as either protective or mediating factor.
4. Moran, Turiano, & Gentzler (2018), “Parental warmth during childhood predicts coping and well-being in adulthood” (Journal of Family Psychology 32(5):610–621, DOI:10.1037/fam0000401). Longitudinal data connect early parental warmth to better adult coping, bolstering hypotheses about parental guidance and positive family relations predicting adult relationship satisfaction and self-esteem in the survey.
5. Kim et al. (2025), “Identifying childhood correlates of adult purpose and meaning across 22 countries (Global Flourishing Study)” (_npj Mental Health Research_ 4(1): DOI:10.1038/s44184-025-00127-9). Cross-national analysis finds childhood abuse, family economic stability, and religious service attendance among factors that shape adult purpose/meaning, encouraging cross-national sensitivity in the current dataset and attention to religion plus class pathways.
6. Kuhar, Dorrance-Hall, & Prosen (2024), “The Effect of Adverse and Positive Childhood Experiences, Attachment, and Emotional Support on Adult Mental Health” (_European Journal of Mental Health_ 19:1–19, DOI:10.5708/ejmh.19.2024.0031). Path analysis reveals how ACEs elevate anxious attachment while positive childhood experiences (PCEs) buffer emotional support and mental health, guiding the combination of adversity and positive signals in our hypotheses.
7. Košárková et al. (2020), “Anxiety and Avoidance in Adults and Childhood Trauma Are Associated with Negative Religious Coping” (_International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health_ 17(14):5147, DOI:10.3390/ijerph17145147). Childhood trauma and insecure attachment increase the odds of negative religious coping, suggesting religiosity variables may capture both protective and stress-amplifying dynamics in the same individuals.
8. Piper, Lambert, & Fuller (2022), “The Impact of Religious Participation and Religious Upbringing on the Sexual Behavior of Emerging Adults in The Southern United States” (_Sexuality & Culture_ 26:1711–1731, DOI:10.1007/s12119-022-09965-7). Religious upbringing interacts with sexual behavior norms, providing grounding to interpret the survey's purity-culture and sexual-experience items alongside adult wellbeing outcomes.
9. Schooler, Ward, Merriwether, & Caruthers (2005), “Cycles of shame: Menstrual shame, body shame, and sexual decision-making” (_Journal of Sex Research_ 42(4):324–334, DOI:10.1080/00224490509552288). The authors describe how shame around menstruation, body image, and sexual activity cohere and predict worse sexual health and psychological distress, reinforcing the salience of purity messaging as a potential source of adult shame in our dataset.

These references supply the grounding that will shape our hypotheses in the next step.
