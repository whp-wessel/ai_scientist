# Literature and background notes

## Dataset scoping (literature phase)
- `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` has 14,443 respondents and 718 columns. The built-in script `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` reproducibly reports national origins (U.S. ~7,500, U.K. ~1,200, Canada ~950, Australia ~545, others), self-reported religion categories, and distributions of class and wellbeing indicators.
- Early descriptive indicators show adult subjective wellbeing scales (e.g., "I love myself" mean ≈ 0.61, "I am not happy" mean ≈ 0.15, the satisfaction-with-work scale mean ≈ 0.12) with Likert-type ranges from -3 to 3, as well as a positive median (1–2) on parental guidance items and more negative/mixed values on purity-culture teaching.
- The survey captures extensive childhood context (verbal/emotional abuse, sexual abuse indicators, parental monitoring, purity messaging, socio-economic class across childhood/teen/current, and religion/social preference variables) along with adult mental health/wellbeing items (e.g., depression, anxiety, relationship satisfaction, self-esteem, career satisfaction).

## Key literature
1. Felitti et al. (1998), _Relationship of Childhood Abuse and Household Dysfunction to Many of the Leading Causes of Death in Adults_ (AJPM 14(4):245–258). The ACE study demonstrates a graded relationship between number of adverse childhood experiences and adult mental/physical health risks, supporting the use of childhood abuse/household dysfunction measures as predictors of adult depression/anxiety indicators.
2. Umberson & Montez (2010), _Social Relationships and Health: A Flashpoint for Health Policy_ (J Health Soc Behav 51:S54–S66). Establishes social bonds (family, parental support, guidance) as protective factors for mental wellbeing over the life course, suggesting variables such as parental guidance, family stability, and current relationship satisfaction can interlink.
3. Koenig, King, & Carson (2012), _Handbook of Religion and Health_ (Oxford University Press). A comprehensive review showing that active religious engagement (current practice, childhood religious salience) is consistently associated with lower depression and higher subjective wellbeing, motivating hypotheses involving religiosity as either protective or mediating factor.

These references supply the grounding that will shape our hypotheses in the next step.
