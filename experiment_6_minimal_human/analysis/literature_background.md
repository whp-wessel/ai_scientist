# Literature and background notes

## Dataset scoping (literature phase)
- `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` has 14,443 respondents and 718 columns. The built-in script `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` reproducibly reports national origins (U.S. ~7,500, U.K. ~1,200, Canada ~950, Australia ~545, others), self-reported religion categories, and distributions of class and wellbeing indicators.
- Running `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` confirms the numeric summaries above and highlights that parental guidance items (mean ≈0.63) are clustered toward positive endorsement while purity-culture teaching skews negative (mean ≈–0.22), illustrating readily measurable tension between supportive and restrictive upbringings within the same respondents.
- Early descriptive indicators show adult subjective wellbeing scales (e.g., "I love myself" mean ≈ 0.61, "I am not happy" mean ≈ 0.15, the satisfaction-with-work scale mean ≈ 0.12) with Likert-type ranges from -3 to 3, as well as a positive median (1–2) on parental guidance items and more negative/mixed values on purity-culture teaching.
- The survey captures extensive childhood context (verbal/emotional abuse, sexual abuse indicators, parental monitoring, purity messaging, socio-economic class across childhood/teen/current, and religion/social preference variables) along with adult mental health/wellbeing items (e.g., depression, anxiety, relationship satisfaction, self-esteem, career satisfaction).
- A fresh run of `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` (Rows: 14,443; `classchild` mean ≈2.62, `classteen` mean ≈2.76, `classcurrent` mean ≈3.02; `I love myself` mean ≈0.61; `I am not happy` mean ≈0.15; `I am satisfied with my work/career life` mean ≈0.12; parental guidance mean ≈0.63; purity-culture teaching mean ≈–0.22) confirms that these constructs hold substantive variance and that the script can reproduce the same summaries whenever rerun.

## Key literature
1. Felitti et al. (1998), _Relationship of Childhood Abuse and Household Dysfunction to Many of the Leading Causes of Death in Adults_ (AJPM 14(4):245–258). The ACE study demonstrates a graded relationship between number of adverse childhood experiences and adult mental/physical health risks, supporting the use of childhood abuse/household dysfunction measures as predictors of adult depression/anxiety indicators.
2. Umberson & Montez (2010), _Social Relationships and Health: A Flashpoint for Health Policy_ (J Health Soc Behav 51:S54–S66). Establishes social bonds (family, parental support, guidance) as protective factors for mental wellbeing over the life course, suggesting variables such as parental guidance, family stability, and current relationship satisfaction can interlink.
3. Koenig, King, & Carson (2012), _Handbook of Religion and Health_ (Oxford University Press). A comprehensive review showing that active religious engagement (current practice, childhood religious salience) is consistently associated with lower depression and higher subjective wellbeing, motivating hypotheses involving religiosity as either protective or mediating factor.
4. Moran, Turiano, & Gentzler (2018), “Parental warmth during childhood predicts coping and well-being in adulthood” (Journal of Family Psychology 32(5):610–621, DOI:10.1037/fam0000401). Longitudinal data connect early parental warmth to better adult coping, bolstering hypotheses about parental guidance and positive family relations predicting adult relationship satisfaction and self-esteem in the survey.
5. Kim et al. (2025), “Identifying childhood correlates of adult purpose and meaning across 22 countries (Global Flourishing Study)” (_npj Mental Health Research_ 4(1): DOI:10.1038/s44184-025-00127-9). Cross-national analysis finds childhood abuse, family economic stability, and religious service attendance among factors that shape adult purpose/meaning, encouraging cross-national sensitivity in the current dataset and attention to religion plus class pathways.
6. Kuhar, Dorrance-Hall, & Prosen (2024), “The Effect of Adverse and Positive Childhood Experiences, Attachment, and Emotional Support on Adult Mental Health” (_European Journal of Mental Health_ 19:1–19, DOI:10.5708/ejmh.19.2024.0031). Path analysis reveals how ACEs elevate anxious attachment while positive childhood experiences (PCEs) buffer emotional support and mental health, guiding the combination of adversity and positive signals in our hypotheses.
7. Košárková et al. (2020), “Anxiety and Avoidance in Adults and Childhood Trauma Are Associated with Negative Religious Coping” (_International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health_ 17(14):5147, DOI:10.3390/ijerph17145147). Childhood trauma and insecure attachment increase the odds of negative religious coping, suggesting religiosity variables may capture both protective and stress-amplifying dynamics in the same individuals.
8. Piper, Lambert, & Fuller (2022), “The Impact of Religious Participation and Religious Upbringing on the Sexual Behavior of Emerging Adults in The Southern United States” (_Sexuality & Culture_ 26:1711–1731, DOI:10.1007/s12119-022-09965-7). Religious upbringing interacts with sexual behavior norms, providing grounding to interpret the survey's purity-culture and sexual-experience items alongside adult wellbeing outcomes.
9. Schooler, Ward, Merriwether, & Caruthers (2005), “Cycles of shame: Menstrual shame, body shame, and sexual decision-making” (_Journal of Sex Research_ 42(4):324–334, DOI:10.1080/00224490509552288). The authors describe how shame around menstruation, body image, and sexual activity cohere and predict worse sexual health and psychological distress, reinforcing the salience of purity messaging as a potential source of adult shame in our dataset.
10. Cohen & Wills (1985), “Stress, social support, and the buffering hypothesis” (_Psychological Bulletin_ 98(2):310–357, DOI:10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.310). This meta-analysis shows that perceived social support can blunt the negative impact of stressors, providing direct precedent for treating current social circles as moderators of childhood adversity.
11. Jung (2017), “Religious salience and spiritual buffering for victims of childhood abuse” (_Research on Aging_ 39(6):691–712, DOI:10.1177/0164027516686662). The study identifies religiosity/spirituality as a moderator of the emotional implications of childhood abuse, aligning with our interest in current religious practice and purity messaging.

These references supply the grounding that will shape our hypotheses in the next step.

## Candidate research directions this loop
- Paired childhood adversity (verbal/emotional abuse exposures from the 0–12 and 13–18 modules) with adult distress ratings (`I tend to suffer from depression`, `I am not happy`, `I love myself`, etc.) to replicate the graded, long-term effects described by Felitti et al. (1998) and Sheinbaum et al. (2024), while keeping ACE-style indices visible during analysis.
- Tested how current relational resources (e.g., `In general, people in my current social circles tend treat me really well`) might buffer distress using the stress-buffering framework of Cohen & Wills (1985) and the protective-family perspective of Umberson & Montez (2010), including potential interaction terms between abuse and support and cross-national comparisons.
- Explored the religiosity/purity-culture dimension (current practice, childhood teaching, and negative coping narratives) as either protective or stress-amplifying in the face of adversity, building on Jung (2017), Košárková et al. (2020), Koenig et al. (2012), Piper et al. (2022), and Schooler et al. (2005) to interpret mixed signals in the dataset.
- Traced how early-life socio-economic standing (`classchild`, `classteen`) predicts adult economic perceptions (`classcurrent`, `networth`) and subjective wellbeing (self-love, career satisfaction), in line with Cheng & Furnham (2014) and Kim et al. (2025), and whether positive parental messaging softens the consequences of lower childhood class.

## Loop 24 descriptive update
- Re-ran `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` to refresh the reproducible anchor; the latest run still reports 14,443 rows and the same top countries (United States 7,498; United Kingdom 1,191; Canada 963; Australia 545; Other Europe (west) 443).
- The script also corroborates the leading religion codes (0.0: 9,958; 1.0: 2,577; 2.0: 1,134; 3.0: 774), and it reaffirmed the earlier means for key constructs (`classchild` ≈2.62, `classteen` ≈2.76, `classcurrent` ≈3.02, `I love myself` ≈0.61, `I am not happy` ≈0.15, `I am satisfied with my work/career life` ≈0.12, parental guidance ≈0.63, purity-culture teaching ≈–0.22).
- These reproducible benchmarks provide a stable backdrop for downstream hypothesis testing and ensure that future researchers can rerun the script to recreate the same descriptive picture before modeling starts.
