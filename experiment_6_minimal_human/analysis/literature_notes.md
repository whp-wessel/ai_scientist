# Literature Notes

## Dataset overview
- **Sample**: 14,443 respondents across 718 question columns derived from the balanced-childhood public survey.
- **Demographics**: Ages range from 18 to 75 (mean 30.4, SD 10.2); detailed variables capture gender identity, ethnicity, education, class, net worth, and religious background.
- **Psychosocial measurements**: Many Likert-type items coded from −3 to 3 describe adulthood well-being (e.g., anxiety, depression, relationship satisfaction, life satisfaction) and childhood experiences (e.g., parental guidance, family humor, media restrictions, teachings about purity).
- **Key outcome candidates**: adult emotional health (e.g., `I tend to suffer from anxiety (npvfh98)-neg`, `I tend to suffer from depression (wz901dj)`, and `In the past 4 weeks, you've had difficulty accomplishing things due to emotional issues (kd4qc3z)`), relational satisfaction (`I am satisfied with my romantic relationships (hp9qz6f)`), and self-regard (`I love myself (2l8994l)`).
- **Key exposure candidates**: childhood family cohesion/guidance (`during ages 0-12: Your parents gave useful guidance (pqo6jmj)` / `during ages 13-18: Your parents gave useful guidance (dcrx5ab)`), family culture (e.g., joking or stress), and religiosity variables (`Do you currently actively practice a religion? (902tbll)`, `religion`, `Religionchildhood`, `externalreligion`).
- **Coding notes**: Many scale items present negative/positive labels (e.g., columns ending with `-neg`); the dataset will require consistent recoding (higher values representing higher endorsement) and transparent handling of missing data.

## Relevant literature
- Cobb et al. (2024), *Perceived childhood family cohesiveness prior to deployment prospectively moderates risk for war-zone psychopathology in theater among deployed U.S. soldiers* (Psychological Trauma). This recent peer-reviewed study shows that greater perceived childhood family cohesion predicts lower psychopathology in later high-stress environments, which supports examining childhood socialization and adult emotional health in the current dataset.
- Koenig (2012), *Religion, Spirituality, and Health: The Research and Clinical Implications* (ISRN Psychiatry). This widely cited review documents robust associations between religiosity/spirituality and mental well-being, suggesting that current or remembered religious engagement may correlate with adult emotional outcomes in the survey.
- Felitti et al. (1998), *Relationship of Childhood Abuse and Household Dysfunction to Many of the Leading Causes of Death in Adults* (American Journal of Preventive Medicine 14(4):245–258). The ACE study shows a strong, graded link between cumulative childhood adversity and adult depression, anxiety, and mortality, motivating hypotheses that the survey’s abuse/bullying items (e.g., sexual abuse indicators, verbal/emotional abuse, bullying) will correlate with adult mental health scales.
- Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman (2002), *Risky Families: Family Social Environments and the Mental and Physical Health of Offspring* (Psychological Bulletin 128(2):330–366). This meta-analytic synthesis establishes how early family warmth and parental guidance buffer stress reactivity and support better adult mental health, reinforcing the use of parental guidance, household humor, and current relationship satisfaction measures as predictors of adult well-being.
- Wolke & Lereya (2015), “Long-term effects of bullying” (Archives of Disease in Childhood 100(9):879–885). Their longitudinal review links peer victimization during childhood to elevated risks of adult anxiety and depression, supporting inclusion of the survey’s bullying indicators from ages 0–12 and 13–18 in any adversity-focused hypotheses.

## Hypothesis guidance
- Exposure → Outcome 1: Higher exposure to childhood adversity (sexual abuse, parental verbal/emotional abuse, bullying in early ages) will predict elevated adult symptoms of depression and anxiety. The Felitti et al. (1998) ACE findings and Wolke & Lereya (2015) sustain this pathway, and the dataset directly captures these exposures alongside adult anxiety/depression Likert items.
- Exposure → Outcome 2: Greater perceived parental guidance/warmth in childhood (0–12 and 13–18 guidance items, family humor and cohesion scales) will be associated with higher adult self-esteem and relationship satisfaction. Repetti et al. (2002) and Moran et al. (2018) document similar effects, so these columns can be modeled as protective factors for adult wellbeing metrics like `I love myself (2l8994l)` and `I am satisfied with my romantic relationships (hp9qz6f)`.
## Next-phase considerations
- Prioritize defining reproducible variable construction for exposures (e.g., recoding `pqo6jmj`, `dcrx5ab`, the multi-level religiosity question) and outcomes (e.g., standardizing anxiety/depression items).
- Outline covariates for later models (age, gender/cis indicators, class, education, parental socioeconomic status from `classchild`/`classteen`).
- Document data-cleaning steps (missingness thresholds, scale direction) so future loops can reproduce preprocessing.
