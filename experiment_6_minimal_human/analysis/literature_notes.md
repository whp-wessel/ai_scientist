# Literature Notes

## Dataset overview
- **Sample**: 14,443 respondents across 718 question columns derived from the balanced-childhood public survey.
- **Demographics**: Ages range from 18 to 75 (mean 30.4, SD 10.2); detailed variables capture gender identity, ethnicity, education, class, net worth, and religious background.
- **Geography**: Respondents originate primarily from the United States (7,498), United Kingdom (1,191), Canada (963), Australia (545), and Other Western European countries (443), so subsequent models can account for these dominant clusters while still acknowledging smaller non-Western contingents.
- **Psychosocial measurements**: Many Likert-type items coded from −3 to 3 describe adulthood well-being (e.g., anxiety, depression, relationship satisfaction, life satisfaction) and childhood experiences (e.g., parental guidance, family humor, media restrictions, teachings about purity).
- **Religiosity distribution**: The current-practice question records 9,958 “No” responses but also 2,576 “Yes, slightly”, 1,134 “Yes, moderately”, and 774 “Yes, very seriously” responses (with only 6 missing), so it carries ordinal spread for gradated religious engagement.
- **Economic anchor**: The net worth question clusters around $100,000 (3,763) and $10,000 (3,524) but maintains tails—from $1,000,000 (2,004) to debt categories such as −$10,000 (795)—which allows modeling both positive economic mobility and indebtedness.
- **Key outcome candidates**: adult emotional health (e.g., `I tend to suffer from anxiety (npvfh98)-neg`, `I tend to suffer from depression (wz901dj)`, and `In the past 4 weeks, you've had difficulty accomplishing things due to emotional issues (kd4qc3z)`), relational satisfaction (`I am satisfied with my romantic relationships (hp9qz6f)`), and self-regard (`I love myself (2l8994l)`).
- **Key exposure candidates**: childhood family cohesion/guidance (`during ages 0-12: Your parents gave useful guidance (pqo6jmj)` / `during ages 13-18: Your parents gave useful guidance (dcrx5ab)`), family culture (e.g., joking or stress), and religiosity variables (`Do you currently actively practice a religion? (902tbll)`, `religion`, `Religionchildhood`, `externalreligion`).
- **Coding notes**: Many scale items present negative/positive labels (e.g., columns ending with `-neg`); the dataset will require consistent recoding (higher values representing higher endorsement) and transparent handling of missing data.

## Relevant literature
- Cobb et al. (2024), *Perceived childhood family cohesiveness prior to deployment prospectively moderates risk for war-zone psychopathology in theater among deployed U.S. soldiers* (Psychological Trauma). This recent peer-reviewed study shows that greater perceived childhood family cohesion predicts lower psychopathology in later high-stress environments, which supports examining childhood socialization and adult emotional health in the current dataset.
- Koenig (2012), *Religion, Spirituality, and Health: The Research and Clinical Implications* (ISRN Psychiatry). This widely cited review documents robust associations between religiosity/spirituality and mental well-being, suggesting that current or remembered religious engagement may correlate with adult emotional outcomes in the survey.
- Felitti et al. (1998), *Relationship of Childhood Abuse and Household Dysfunction to Many of the Leading Causes of Death in Adults* (American Journal of Preventive Medicine 14(4):245–258). The ACE study shows a strong, graded link between cumulative childhood adversity and adult depression, anxiety, and mortality, motivating hypotheses that the survey’s abuse/bullying items (e.g., sexual abuse indicators, verbal/emotional abuse, bullying) will correlate with adult mental health scales.
- Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman (2002), *Risky Families: Family Social Environments and the Mental and Physical Health of Offspring* (Psychological Bulletin 128(2):330–366). This meta-analytic synthesis establishes how early family warmth and parental guidance buffer stress reactivity and support better adult mental health, reinforcing the use of parental guidance, household humor, and current relationship satisfaction measures as predictors of adult well-being.
- Wolke & Lereya (2015), “Long-term effects of bullying” (Archives of Disease in Childhood 100(9):879–885). Their longitudinal review links peer victimization during childhood to elevated risks of adult anxiety and depression, supporting inclusion of the survey’s bullying indicators from ages 0–12 and 13–18 in any adversity-focused hypotheses.
- Jung (2017), “Religious salience and spiritual buffering for victims of childhood abuse” (Research on Aging 39(6):691–712, DOI:10.1177/0164027516686662). This study shows religiosity can buffer some of the emotional fallout from abuse, justifying how our religiosity measures may moderate the link between adversity and adult distress.
- Abbott & Slack (2021), “Exploring the relationship between childhood adversity and adult depression: A risk versus strengths-oriented approach” (Child Abuse & Neglect 120:105207, DOI:10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105207). The authors demonstrate a dose-response between adversity and adult depression while highlighting how present psychosocial strengths (e.g., support networks) alter risk, which aligns with modeling the survey’s abuse items together with buffering factors like social support and parental guidance.
- Bethell et al. (2019), “Positive Childhood Experiences and Adult Mental and Relational Health in a Statewide Sample” (JAMA Pediatrics 173(11):e193007, DOI:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.3007). Their statewide analysis shows that positive childhood experiences (e.g., supportive families, resilience skills) independently predict lower adult depression/anxiety and better relationships even after adjusting for ACEs, supporting hypotheses that parental guidance and family humor will correlate with higher adult self-esteem/relationship satisfaction in our data set.
- "Risks and resilience — rewriting childhood adversity" (Nature Mental Health 2024, DOI:10.1038/s44220-024-00375-2). The editorial reframes adversity research to highlight the simultaneous modeling of risks and protective factors, reinforcing our decision to treat both abuse exposures and parental guidance as part of the same causal schema.
- Martin, Kirkcaldy, & Siefen (2003), “Antecedents of adult wellbeing: adolescent religiosity and health” (Journal of Managerial Psychology 18(4): DOI:10.1108/02683940310484044). Longitudinal evidence from this paper ties adolescent religiosity to better adult wellbeing, giving a direct peer-reviewed precedent for our religiosity → self-love/relationship satisfaction pathway.
- Diggs, Deniz, & Toseeb (2024), “School connectedness as a protective factor between childhood adversity and adolescent mental health outcomes” (Development and Psychopathology; DOI:10.1017/S0954579424001184). Using Millennium Cohort Study data, the authors find that school connectedness at age 11 buffers the effect of childhood adversity on internalizing and externalizing symptoms, underlining the value of modeling both risks and supportive community assets in the current dataset.
- Alsughier (2024), “The impact of early childhood adversity on mental health outcomes” (ASEAN Journal of Psychiatry, DOI:10.54615/2231-7805.47360). This overview highlights the lasting effects of abuse, neglect, and violence on adult psychological health and calls for interventions that address intergenerational transmission of adversity, which mirrors the dataset’s emphasis on both childhood abuse exposures and subsequent adult well-being.
- Bosquet Enlow et al. (2024), “The influence of early childhood education and care on the relation between early-life social adversity and children's mental health in the Environmental influences for Child Health Outcomes Program” (Development and Psychopathology, DOI:10.1017/S0954579424001822). Their null findings for childcare attendance but interactive effects of psychosocial and socioeconomic risks reinforce the need to carefully distinguish different types of childhood adversity and to model socioeconomic and attachment variables simultaneously.
- Pham, Le, & Nguyen (2024), “Effects of family relationships in Vietnamese culture on mental health problems among adults during the COVID-19 lockdown” (Anthropological Researches and Studies, DOI:10.26758/14.1.12). Family conflict and expressiveness explain 12–14% of depression, anxiety, and stress variation under crisis, which supports the idea that current relational support or conflict features in the survey can meaningfully explain adult distress even after accounting for childhood exposures.
- Copeland et al. (2023), “Cultural contributions to adults' self-rated mental health problems and strengths: 7 culture clusters, 28 societies, 16 906 adults” (Psychological Medicine, DOI:10.1017/S0033291723001332). The hierarchical modeling shows most variance remains at the individual level but that society/culture still explains meaningful shares of mental health variation, reminding us to be cautious when interpreting Western-majority samples and to report heterogeneity by region when possible.

## Hypothesis guidance
- Exposure → Outcome 1: Higher exposure to childhood adversity (sexual abuse, parental verbal/emotional abuse, bullying in early ages) will predict elevated adult symptoms of depression and anxiety. The Felitti et al. (1998) ACE findings and Wolke & Lereya (2015) sustain this pathway, and the dataset directly captures these exposures alongside adult anxiety/depression Likert items.
- Exposure → Outcome 2: Greater perceived parental guidance/warmth in childhood (0–12 and 13–18 guidance items, family humor and cohesion scales) will be associated with higher adult self-esteem and relationship satisfaction. Repetti et al. (2002) and Moran et al. (2018) document similar effects, so these columns can be modeled as protective factors for adult wellbeing metrics like `I love myself (2l8994l)` and `I am satisfied with my romantic relationships (hp9qz6f)`.
## Next-phase considerations
- Prioritize defining reproducible variable construction for exposures (e.g., recoding `pqo6jmj`, `dcrx5ab`, the multi-level religiosity question) and outcomes (e.g., standardizing anxiety/depression items).
- Outline covariates for later models (age, gender/cis indicators, class, education, parental socioeconomic status from `classchild`/`classteen`).
- Document data-cleaning steps (missingness thresholds, scale direction) so future loops can reproduce preprocessing.
