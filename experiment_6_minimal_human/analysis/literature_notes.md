# Literature Phase Notes

## Dataset overview
- `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` (14,443 respondents) captures retrospective reports of childhood family contexts (`classchild`, `classteen`, family conflict, verbal abuse, parental guidance), religious background (`religion`, `Religionchildhood`, `externalreligion`), and current well-being indicators (e.g., `I tend to suffer from depression`, `I am satisfied with my romantic relationships`, `In general, people in my current social circles tend treat me really well`).
- Additional sociodemographic variables include age, gender identity, net worth, current class, and indicators of social/legal experiences (e.g., `Have you ever had a sexual experience with someone else who did not want the experience?`).
- Because the data pair childhood exposure measures with adult mental-health/self-concept items, it is well suited for retrospective analyses of adversity → adult well-being linkages.

## Relevant literature
- Felitti et al. (1998) document that childhood abuse and household dysfunction are strongly associated with leading causes of adult morbidity and mortality, including depression, substance use, and chronic disease; their ACEs framework underpins the hypothesis that early adversity has lasting mental-health effects (American Journal of Preventive Medicine, DOI:10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8).
- Jung (2017) finds that religious salience and spirituality buffer the negative effects of childhood abuse on positive affect trajectories in U.S. adults, suggesting that residual religious resources may moderate how adversity maps onto current well-being (Research on Aging, DOI:10.1177/0164027516686662).
- Bellis et al. (2017) show that continuous trusted-adult support in childhood predicts resilience against adult health-harming behaviors and poor mental well-being even after controlling for multiple ACEs, indicating that supportive relationships can shift adverse life-course trajectories (BMC Psychiatry, DOI:10.1186/s12888-017-1260-z).
