# Literature Phase Notes

## Dataset overview
- `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` (14,443 respondents) captures retrospective reports of childhood family contexts (`classchild`, `classteen`, family conflict, verbal abuse, parental guidance), religious background (`religion`, `Religionchildhood`, `externalreligion`), and current well-being indicators (e.g., `I tend to suffer from depression`, `I am satisfied with my romantic relationships`, `In general, people in my current social circles tend treat me really well`).
- Additional sociodemographic variables include age, gender identity, net worth, current class, and indicators of social/legal experiences (e.g., `Have you ever had a sexual experience with someone else who did not want the experience?`).
- Because the data pair childhood exposure measures with adult mental-health/self-concept items, it is well suited for retrospective analyses of adversity → adult well-being linkages.
- Running `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` reproduces the tabulated counts/means for reproducibility (Rows: 14,443; top countries: United States 7,498, United Kingdom 1,191, Canada 963, Australia 545, Other Europe 443; religion mode: 0.0 with 9,958 respondents) plus the summaries for subjective class, self-love, unhappiness, work satisfaction, parental guidance, and purity-culture teaching described in `analysis/literature_background.md`.
- A follow-up run now confirms that the main constructs still show the same range and variance (classchild mean ≈2.62, classteen ≈2.76, classcurrent ≈3.02; `I love myself` mean ≈0.61; `I am not happy` mean ≈0.15; parental guidance mean ≈0.63; purity-culture teaching mean ≈–0.22), providing a reproducible reference point for exposures and outcomes.
- The updated `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` now extends those reproducible anchors by printing the summaries for abuse exposures, support, depression/anxiety, religion, and net worth, while automatically surfacing the top categories for text columns so future loops can re-run the same scoping before modeling.
- The current social-support question exists in two near-identical forms (`tmt46e6` and `71mn55g`); the latter captures 14,054 responses with mean ≈1.68 while `tmt46e6` has only 383 non-missing cases, so analyses will treat `71mn55g` as the primary indicator and keep `tmt46e6` for robustness checks or measurement error exploration.
- Religion-practice (`Do you *currently* actively practice a religion? (902tbll)`) and net worth (`Your CURRENT net worth is closest to (nhoz8ia)`) are stored as string categories (e.g., “No”, “Yes, slightly”, “$10,000”) with minimal missingness; we will pre-register the ordinal mapping (0–3 for religiosity, an ordered scale for net worth) as part of the PAP because these items cannot be fed directly into numeric models.
- Depression (`I tend to suffer from depression (wz901dj)`) and anxiety (`I tend to suffer from anxiety (npvfh98)-neg`) already have near-complete coverage with expected negative-anchored means, so we can treat them as continuous outcomes while noting that their coding centers below zero when framing expected directions.

## Relevant literature
- Felitti et al. (1998) document that childhood abuse and household dysfunction are strongly associated with leading causes of adult morbidity and mortality, including depression, substance use, and chronic disease; their ACEs framework underpins the hypothesis that early adversity has lasting mental-health effects (American Journal of Preventive Medicine, DOI:10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8).
- Jung (2017) finds that religious salience and spirituality buffer the negative effects of childhood abuse on positive affect trajectories in U.S. adults, suggesting that residual religious resources may moderate how adversity maps onto current well-being (Research on Aging, DOI:10.1177/0164027516686662).
- Bellis et al. (2017) show that continuous trusted-adult support in childhood predicts resilience against adult health-harming behaviors and poor mental well-being even after controlling for multiple ACEs, indicating that supportive relationships can shift adverse life-course trajectories (BMC Psychiatry, DOI:10.1186/s12888-017-1260-z).

## Additional sources gathered this loop
- Kim et al. (2025) examine 11 childhood factors across 22 countries (Global Flourishing Study) and find that abuse, family economic hardship, and parental relationships map onto adult purpose/meaning, reinforcing that our cross-national dataset can speak to similar pathways (NPJ Mental Health Research, DOI:10.1038/s44184-025-00127-9).
- Kuhar et al. (2024) use Slovenian data to show that ACEs increase anxious attachment while positive childhood experiences buffer emotional support and mental health, which motivates modelling combined adversity/PCE indices (European Journal of Mental Health, DOI:10.5708/ejmh.19.2024.0031).
- Košárková et al. (2020) document that childhood trauma is associated with negative religious coping and both anxiety+avoidance attachment, highlighting that the dataset’s religiosity and purity-culture variables might capture mixed coping strategies (International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, DOI:10.3390/ijerph17145147).
- Moran et al. (2018) demonstrate parental warmth predicts adult coping and well-being, providing justification for treating parental guidance items (pqo6jmj) as positive childhood supports (Journal of Family Psychology, DOI:10.1037/fam0000401).
- Piper et al. (2022) highlight that religious upbringing and participation shape emerging adults’ sexual behavior, which makes the survey’s sexual-experience and purity-culture modules relevant when speculating about adult intimate satisfaction (Sexuality & Culture, DOI:10.1007/s12119-022-09965-7).
- Schooler, Ward, Merriwether, & Caruthers (2005) describe how menstrual shame, body shame, and sexual decision-making cohere as a shame system that undermines sexual health and ties to higher psychological distress, reinforcing the theoretical link between purity-culture teachings and adult mental health in our data (Journal of Sex Research 42(4):324–334, DOI:10.1080/00224490509552288).
- Sheinbaum et al. (2024) use longitudinal data to demonstrate that graded dimensions of childhood adversity—particularly emotional/relational conflict—predict adult symptoms of psychosis, anxiety, and depression, reinforcing the dataset’s ability to test how these adversity dimensions map onto current affect (Schizophrenia Research 270:102–110, DOI:10.1016/j.schres.2024.05.016).
- Cheng & Furnham (2014) show that parental socioeconomic conditions and childhood intelligence predict adult personality, social status, and mental well-being, supporting the plan to relate early class perceptions (`classchild`, `classteen`) to adult economic and satisfaction outcomes in the survey (Social Indicators Research 117(2):653–664, DOI:10.1007/s11205-013-0364-1).
