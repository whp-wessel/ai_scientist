# Hypotheses (literature phase)

## Hypothesis 1 – Childhood family cohesion protects adult emotional health
- **Statement**: Individuals reporting more positive childhood family cohesion or guidance (ages 0-12 and 13-18) will report lower levels of adult emotional distress (anxiety, depression, and functional impairment due to emotional issues).
- **Data plan**: Use `during ages *0-12*: Your parents gave useful guidance (pqo6jmj)` and `during ages *13-18*: Your parents gave useful guidance (dcrx5ab)` as primary exposures; additional cohesion indicators such as joking/pranks and emotional abuse columns can serve as robustness checks. Outcomes include `I tend to suffer from anxiety (npvfh98)-neg`, `I tend to suffer from depression (wz901dj)`, and `In the past 4 weeks, you've had difficulty accomplishing things due to emotional issues (kd4qc3z)` after harmonizing directionality and addressing missingness. Models will control for age (`selfage`), gender categories (`biomale/gendermale/cis`), current socioeconomic status (`classcurrent`, `education`, `networth`), and childhood socioeconomic proxies (`classchild`, `classteen`).
- **Literature support**: Cobb et al. (2024) show that perceived childhood family cohesiveness moderates risk for later psychopathology in stressful deployments, suggesting family cohesion can provide enduring protection for adult emotional health (Psychological Trauma, 2024).

## Hypothesis 2 – Religiosity and psychological well-being
- **Statement**: Active religiosity (current practice intensity) and positive childhood religiosity (e.g., importance placed on religious adherence) are associated with better adult psychological well-being, including greater relationship satisfaction and self-love and lower self-reported unhappiness.
- **Data plan**: Current religiosity is captured by `Do you *currently* actively practice a religion? (902tbll)` (ordinal response) and `externalreligion` (importance of adherence during childhood). Outcomes include `I am satisfied with my romantic relationships (hp9qz6f)`, `I love myself (2l8994l)`, and `I am not happy (ix5iyv3)-neg` (after rescaling). The regression set will control for age, gender, socioeconomic status, and childhood family context to isolate the religiosity association.
- **Literature support**: Koenig (2012) reviews extensive research showing that religiosity/spirituality is generally linked with better psychological well-being, which provides a theoretical grounding for testing religiosity effects in this dataset (ISRN Psychiatry, 2012).
