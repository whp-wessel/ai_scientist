# Hypothesis inventory

## Hypothesis 1: Childhood emotional/sexual abuse predicts adult depression/anxiety
- **Exposure proxies:** `during ages *0-12*: your parents verbally or emotionally abused you (mds78zu)`, `during ages *13-18*: your parents verbally or emotionally abused you (v1k988q)`, and the sexual abuse indicators such as `during ages *0-12*: a household member sexually abused you in a way *included* genital penetration or envelopment (949atsn)`.
- **Outcomes:** Adult negative affect captured by `I am not happy (ix5iyv3)-neg`, `I tend to suffer from depression (wz901dj)`, and `I tend to suffer from anxiety (npvfh98)-neg` provide multiple self-report pivot points.
- **Expected direction:** More negative scores (higher agreement with abuse) should be associated with higher levels of depressed/anxious responses, consistent with the graded trauma–health gradient in Felitti et al. (1998, *American Journal of Preventive Medicine*).

## Hypothesis 2: Parental guidance and religious practice buffer adult social/romantic wellbeing and self-regard
- **Exposure proxies:** `during ages *0-12*: Your parents gave useful guidance (pqo6jmj)` and `Do you *currently* actively practice a religion? (902tbll)` (with categories from "No" to "Yes, very seriously").
- **Outcomes:** Higher scores on self-love (`I love myself (2l8994l)`) and romantic satisfaction (`I am satisfied with my romantic relationships (hp9qz6f)`) capture social/relational wellbeing.
- **Expected direction:** Greater parental guidance and religious engagement are expected to associate with higher self-regard and satisfaction, aligning with social support findings (Umberson & Montez, 2010) and the religion-and-health literature (Koenig et al., 2012).

## Hypothesis 3: Cumulative childhood adversity dimensions predict adult anxiety, depression, and self-esteem
- **Exposure proxies:** Retrospective indicators of family stress/conflict and emotional struggle (`during ages *0-12*: your parents verbally or emotionally abused you (mds78zu)`, `during ages *13-18*: your parents verbally or emotionally abused you (v1k988q)`, `during ages *0-12*: you felt as though you were 'at war' with yourself in trying to be a good person (wtolilk)`, `during ages *13-18*: you felt as though you were 'at war' with yourself in trying to be a good person (gitjzck)`).
- **Outcomes:** Adult self-reports of negative affect and self-worth (`I tend to suffer from anxiety (npvfh98)-neg`, `I tend to suffer from depression (wz901dj)`, `I am not happy (ix5iyv3)-neg`, `I love myself (2l8994l)`).
- **Expected direction:** Higher adversity/inner conflict during childhood is expected to coincide with higher agreement on anxiety/depression items and lower self-love, consistent with the longitudinal findings that childhood adversity dimensions shape adult anxiety and depression symptoms (Sheinbaum et al., 2024).
- **Citation:** Sheinbaum T. et al. (2024). *A longitudinal study of the impact of childhood adversity dimensions on social and psychological factors and symptoms of psychosis, depression, and anxiety*. Schizophrenia Research 270:102–110. DOI:10.1016/j.schres.2024.05.016.

## Hypothesis 4: Higher childhood socioeconomic status predicts stronger adult economic standing and subjective wellbeing
- **Exposure proxies:** Early-life class perception (`classchild`) and teen-era class (`classteen`) as ordinal assessments of the family's socioeconomic environment.
- **Outcomes:** Adult economic and psychological wellbeing captured by `classcurrent`, `Your CURRENT net worth is closest to (nhoz8ia)` (`networth`), and satisfaction scales such as `I am satisfied with my work/career life (or lack thereof) (z0mhd63)` and `I love myself (2l8994l)`.
- **Expected direction:** Respondents reporting higher class in childhood/teen years are expected to have higher current net worth, class, and life satisfaction, echoing empirical connections between parental SES and adult personality, social status, and mental wellbeing (Cheng & Furnham, 2014).
