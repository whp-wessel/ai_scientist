# Hypothesis inventory

## Hypothesis 1: Childhood emotional/sexual abuse predicts adult depression/anxiety
- **Exposure proxies:** `during ages *0-12*: your parents verbally or emotionally abused you (mds78zu)`, `during ages *13-18*: your parents verbally or emotionally abused you (v1k988q)`, and the sexual abuse indicators such as `during ages *0-12*: a household member sexually abused you in a way *included* genital penetration or envelopment (949atsn)`.
- **Outcomes:** Adult negative affect captured by `I am not happy (ix5iyv3)-neg`, `I tend to suffer from depression (wz901dj)`, and `I tend to suffer from anxiety (npvfh98)-neg` provide multiple self-report pivot points.
- **Expected direction:** More negative scores (higher agreement with abuse) should be associated with higher levels of depressed/anxious responses, consistent with the graded trauma–health gradient in Felitti et al. (1998, *American Journal of Preventive Medicine*).

## Hypothesis 2: Parental guidance and religious practice buffer adult social/romantic wellbeing and self-regard
- **Exposure proxies:** `during ages *0-12*: Your parents gave useful guidance (pqo6jmj)` and `Do you *currently* actively practice a religion? (902tbll)` (with categories from "No" to "Yes, very seriously").
- **Outcomes:** Higher scores on self-love (`I love myself (2l8994l)`) and romantic satisfaction (`I am satisfied with my romantic relationships (hp9qz6f)`) capture social/relational wellbeing.
- **Expected direction:** Greater parental guidance and religious engagement are expected to associate with higher self-regard and satisfaction, aligning with social support findings (Umberson & Montez, 2010) and the religion-and-health literature (Koenig et al., 2012).
