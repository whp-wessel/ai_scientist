# Robustness Narrative
1. **Trimmed weights**: Capping WLS weights at the 99th percentile leaves the H1 coefficients unchanged (anxiety β = -0.135, depression β = 0.193, functional impairment β = -0.163; `artifacts/sensitivity_trimmed_weights_loop64.csv`) and keeps the H2 estimates within ±0.02 of the primary model. The trimming also preserves the sign and magnitude of the H3 interaction coefficients (`artifacts/sensitivity_trimmed_weights_loop64.csv`), reassuring us that a small number of extreme weights do not drive the findings.
2. **Alternative composites**: Replacing the guidance index with a combined guidance + playful cohesion measure reproduces the H1 pattern, while varying the adversity index to focus on (a) verbal/emotional parental abuse and (b) feelings of being at war with oneself maintains similar adversity × support effects for all four outcomes (`artifacts/sensitivity_cohesion_loop64.csv`, `artifacts/sensitivity_adversity_loop64.csv`). The consistent signs across these composites support the robustness of the relational constructs.
3. **Guidance–depression diagnostics**: The originally unexpected positive guidance → depression coefficient matches the raw correlation between the unstandardized items (r = 0.270) and the binned means that transition from below-average depression at low guidance to above-average depression at high guidance (`artifacts/guidance_depression_sensitivity_loop64.csv`). These diagnostics suggest nonlinearity or measurement heterogeneity rather than an artifact of weighting.
4. **Sample stability**: The H1 analytic sample (N ≈ 14,430) shows negligible differences from the full weight-positive sample on age, gender, and class (see `artifacts/h1_sample_comparison_loop64.csv`), and the variance-inflation checks limit concerns about multicollinearity (`artifacts/h1_vif_loop64.csv`).
