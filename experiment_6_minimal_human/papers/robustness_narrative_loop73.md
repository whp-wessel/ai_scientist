# Robustness Narrative
1. **Trimmed weights**: Capping weights at the 99th percentile reproduces H1 coefficients (anxiety β = -0.135, depression β = 0.193, functional impairment β = -0.163) and keeps the H2/H3 estimates within ±0.02 of the primary results, reinforcing that high-leverage respondents do not drive the patterns (`artifacts/sensitivity_trimmed_weights_loop73.csv`).
2. **Alternative composites**: The guidance + playful cohesion index converges on the same H1 signs, while the “parental verbal/emotional abuse” and “at war with yourself” adversity constructions retain support-dependent H3 moderation across anxiety, depression, unhappiness, and self-love (`artifacts/sensitivity_cohesion_loop73.csv`, `artifacts/sensitivity_adversity_loop73.csv`).
3. **Guidance–depression diagnostics**: The positive guidance → depression coefficient mirrors the raw correlation (r = 0.270) and the binned means archived in `artifacts/guidance_depression_sensitivity_loop73.csv`, indicating measurement nuance rather than a statistical artifact.
4. **Sample stability**: The analytic sample comparison (`artifacts/h1_sample_comparison_loop73.csv`) and VIF table (`artifacts/h1_vif_loop73.csv`) show negligible departures from the full panel, supporting confidence in the covariate adjustments.
