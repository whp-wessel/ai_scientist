# Robustness Narrative
1. **Trimmed weights**: Capping WLS weights at the 99th percentile reproduces the H1 coefficients (anxiety β = -0.135, depression β = 0.193, functional impairment β = -0.163) while keeping H2/H3 estimates within ±0.02 of the primary results (`artifacts/sensitivity_trimmed_weights_loop66.csv`). The trimmed weights also preserve the sign and magnitude of the H3 interaction coefficients, which reassures that extreme weights do not drive the effects.
2. **Alternative composites**: Replacing the guidance index with the playful cohesion-enhanced composite reproduces H1’s pattern, while the two alternative adversity definitions (parental verbal/emotional abuse and “at war with yourself” feelings) maintain the same moderation signs for anxiety, depression, unhappiness, and self-love (`artifacts/sensitivity_cohesion_loop66.csv`, `artifacts/sensitivity_adversity_loop66.csv`).
3. **Guidance–depression diagnostics**: The unexpected positive guidance → depression coefficient aligns with the raw correlation (r = 0.270) and the binned means saved in `artifacts/guidance_depression_sensitivity_loop66.csv`, highlighting potential nonlinearity rather than an artifact of weighting.
4. **Sample stability**: The analytic sample comparison (`artifacts/h1_sample_comparison_loop66.csv`) shows minimal deviations from the full weight-positive panel, and the VIF table (`artifacts/h1_vif_loop66.csv`) keeps multicollinearity concerns in check.
