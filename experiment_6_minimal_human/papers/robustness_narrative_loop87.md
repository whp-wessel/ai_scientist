# Robustness Narrative
1. **Trimmed weights**: Capping weights at the 99th percentile reproduces the H1 coefficients (anxiety β = -0.135, depression β = 0.193, functional impairment β = -0.163), keeps the H2 estimates within ±0.02, and preserves the H3 interactions (anxiety β = 0.070, depression β = -0.049, unhappiness β = 0.046, self-love β = -0.041); see `artifacts/sensitivity_trimmed_weights_loop87.csv`.
2. **Alternative composites**: The guidance + playful cohesion index converges on the same H1 signs, while both the “parental verbal/emotional abuse” and “at war with yourself” adversity constructions retain the support-dependent H3 moderation across anxiety, depression, unhappiness, and self-love (`artifacts/sensitivity_cohesion_loop87.csv`, `artifacts/sensitivity_adversity_loop87.csv`).
3. **Guidance–depression diagnostics**: The positive guidance → depression coefficient mirrors the raw correlation (r ≈ 0.270), with binned averages archived in `artifacts/guidance_depression_sensitivity_loop87.csv`, suggesting measurement nuance rather than a modeling artifact.
4. **Sample stability**: Analytic sample comparisons and VIF diagnostics show negligible drift from the full Balanced Childhood Survey panel, supporting the covariate adjustments (`artifacts/h1_sample_comparison_loop87.csv`, `artifacts/h1_vif_loop87.csv`).
