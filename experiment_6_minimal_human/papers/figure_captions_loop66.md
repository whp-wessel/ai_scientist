# Figure Captions
1. **H1 guidance coefficients**: Weighted least-squares coefficients (±95% CI) for anxiety (`npvfh98`), depression (`wz901dj`), and functional impairment (`kd4qc3z`) regressed on the standardized guidance index with the registered covariates (N ≈ 14,430 per model). This figure lives at `artifacts/h1_coefficients_loop66.png` and highlights the negative anxiety/impairment effects and the unexpected positive depression coefficient.
2. **H2 religiosity coefficients**: Current and external religiosity coefficients (±95% CI) predicting relationship satisfaction (`hp9qz6f`), self-love (`2l8994l`), and unhappiness (`ix5iyv3`), using the same covariates plus the guidance index; see `artifacts/h2_coefficients_loop66.png`.
3. **H3 interaction coefficients**: Standardized adversity × support interaction coefficients (±95% CI) for anxiety, depression, unhappiness, and self-love that demonstrate outcome-specific moderation; see `artifacts/h3_coefficients_loop66.png`.
4. **H3 simple slopes**: Predicted standard-deviation outcomes across adversity at support = -1, 0, and +1 (covariates held at their means) to illustrate how support steepens or flattens each gradient; plotted in `artifacts/h3_interaction_loop66.png`.
