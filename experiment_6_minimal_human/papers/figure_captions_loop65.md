# Figure Captions
1. **H1 guidance coefficients**: Weighted least-squares coefficients (±95% CI) for anxiety (`npvfh98`), depression (`wz901dj`), and functional impairment (`kd4qc3z`) regressed on the z-scored guidance index with covariates (N ≈ 14,430). This figure is stored at `artifacts/h1_coefficients_loop64.png`, and it highlights the negative effects on anxiety/impairment and the unexpected positive depression coefficient.
2. **H2 religiosity coefficients**: Current and external religiosity coefficients (±95% CI) predicting relationship satisfaction, self-love, and unhappiness using identical covariates (N ≈ 14,430). The image is `artifacts/h2_coefficients_loop64.png`.
3. **H3 interaction coefficients**: Adversity × support coefficients (±95% CI) for anxiety, depression, unhappiness, and self-love, demonstrating outcome-specific moderation effects with standardized predictors; see `artifacts/h3_coefficients_loop64.png`.
4. **H3 simple slopes**: Predicted SD outcomes across adversity at support = -1, 0, and +1 (covariates held at their analytic means), illustrating how support sharpens or flattens the adversity gradient per outcome; see `artifacts/h3_interaction_loop64.png`.
