# Guidance, the Sacred, and Support: How Childhood Experiences Shape Adult Emotional Health in a Global Sample

## Abstract
The Balanced Childhood Survey captures 14,443 respondents who rated their childhood family climate, religious practice, and current emotional wellbeing. We test three preregistered hypotheses drawn from resilience and stress-buffering literatures: that positive childhood family guidance protects adult distress, that religiosity links with wellbeing, and that current social support moderates the lasting impact of childhood adversity. Weighted least-squares regressions with HC3 robust errors (weights from the `weight` column, positive values only) standardize all exposures and outcomes, and Benjamini–Hochberg corrections are applied per hypothesis. Childhood guidance lowers anxiety and impairment but shows an unexpected positive association with depression, while current religiosity modestly predicts greater self-love and lower unhappiness. Support interacts with an adversity index in outcome-specific ways, with simple slopes revealing stronger gradients for anxiety/unhappiness but more protective slopes for depression/self-love. Sensitivity checks (trimmed weights, alternative composites) and descriptive diagnostics are archived to keep the manuscript reproducible.

## Introduction
Felitti and colleagues (1998) first linked adverse childhood experiences with adult physical and mental health, and the protective power of responsive caregiving is now widely documented (Repetti et al., 2002; Bethell et al., 2019). The Balanced Childhood Survey extends those insights by simultaneously measuring positive guidance, verbal/emotional abuse, and later religiosity and support. We test whether guidance shields adult emotional distress, whether religiosity predicts psychological wellbeing as in Koenig’s overview (2012) and Martin, Kirkcaldy, and Siefen’s (2003) longitudinal work, and whether current social circles buffer the adversity–distress slope in the tradition of Cohen and Wills’s (1985) buffering model.

## Methods
#### Data and preprocessing
Analyses use `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` with 14,443 rows of respondents who reported positive sampling weights. Rows with nonpositive weights were excluded, and variables were z-scored so coefficients reflect 1-SD shifts. The guidance index averages two items (pqo6jmj, dcrx5ab), while the adversity index averages eight abuse/conflict items spanning ages 0-12 and 13-18 (see `analysis/run_analysis.py` for precise documentation). Religious practice is captured by current religiosity (`902tbll`) and childhood external religiosity (`externalreligion`), both scaled as ordinal z-scores. Social support uses the `71mn55g` item. Outcomes include anxiety (`npvfh98`), depression (`wz901dj`), functional impairment (`kd4qc3z`), relationship satisfaction (`hp9qz6f`), self-love (`2l8994l`), and unhappiness (`ix5iyv3`); negative-coded items were flipped so higher values uniformly indicate greater distress or dissatisfaction.

#### Modeling
For H1, the guidance index predicts each emotional distress outcome via weighted least-squares with HC3 robust standard errors and the following covariates: age (`selfage`), gender indicators (`biomale`, `gendered`, `cis`), education, class measures (`classchild`, `classteen`, `classcurrent`), net worth, religion, religion during childhood, external religion, and country dummies (USA reference). H2 uses two exposures (current vs. external religiosity) with similar covariates plus the guidance index. H3 fits a product-term regression (`support × adversity`) controlling for the H1 covariates plus current religiosity, yielding interaction coefficients and simple slopes evaluated at ±1 SD support. All regressions were pre-registered, with the plan frozen at commit `808054d3455621759d730efc215ef02802924ff0` (see `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`).

#### Multiple testing and reproducibility
Each hypothesis’s primary exposure(s) across outcomes were adjusted using Benjamini–Hochberg (BH-FDR). All tables, coefficient plots, and environment snapshots (e.g., `artifacts/pip_freeze_loop64.txt`) are archived, and the pipeline is rerunnable via `python analysis/run_analysis.py --loop-index 64`.

## Results
### H1 – Childhood guidance and adult distress
The weighted guidance index is associated with lower anxiety (β = -0.135, 95% CI [-0.152, -0.118], p < 0.001, BH-FDR = 0.000, N = 14,430) and lower functional impairment (β = -0.163, 95% CI [-0.180, -0.146], p < 0.001, BH-FDR = 0.000, N = 14,430) but unexpectedly with higher depression (β = 0.193, 95% CI [0.176, 0.210], p < 0.001, BH-FDR = 0.000, N = 14,431). The depression coefficient persists under trimmed weights and alternative cohesion indices while the correlation between raw guidance and raw depression remains positive (r = 0.270; see artifacts/guidance_depression_sensitivity_loop64.csv). The weighted coefficients are plotted in Figure 1, and the analytic sample comparison is archived in artifacts/h1_sample_comparison_loop64.csv.

### H2 – Religiosity and wellbeing
Current religiosity predicts greater self-love (β = 0.037, 95% CI [0.019, 0.054], p < 0.001, BH-FDR = 0.000, N = 14,428) and lower unhappiness (β = -0.034, 95% CI [-0.051, -0.017], p < 0.001, BH-FDR = 0.000, N = 14,430) while not significantly altering relationship satisfaction (β = 0.008, 95% CI [-0.010, 0.025], p = 0.379). Childhood external religiosity tracks similar but smaller associations (self-love β = 0.017, unhappiness β = 0.000), with BH-adjusted p-values above conventional thresholds for happiness. The H2 coefficients appear in Figure 2.

### H3 – Support moderates adversity
Adversity × support interactions vary by outcome (Figure 3). For anxiety and unhappiness, the interaction coefficients are positive (β = 0.070 and β = 0.046, respectively), indicating that higher support amplifies the adversity gradient; simple slopes show that the anxiety slope grows from 0.132 at support = -1 SD to 0.272 at +1 SD, while unhappiness follows a similar pattern (artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop64.csv). For depression and self-love, the coefficients are negative (β = -0.049 and β = -0.041), meaning that greater support steepens the protective slope; adversity slopes for depression shift from -0.236 at low support to -0.334 at high support. Predicted outcomes along ±1 SD of support at mean adversity are archived in artifacts/h3_predicted_supports_loop64.csv.

## Sensitivity analyses
Trimmed-weight regressions (weights capped at the 99th percentile) reproduce the H1 coefficients (e.g., anxiety β = -0.135, depression β = 0.193) and show that H2 effects remain within ±0.02 of the base estimates (artifacts/sensitivity_trimmed_weights_loop64.csv). Alternative cohesion composites (guidance + playful cohesion) and adversity definitions (e.g., parental verbal/emotional abuse only or “at war with yourself” items) produce the same sign patterns for H1 and H3 (artifacts/sensitivity_cohesion_loop64.csv; artifacts/sensitivity_adversity_loop64.csv). The guidance–depression association’s U-shaped bin averages underscore the nonlinearity that could explain the unexpected directional result (artifacts/guidance_depression_sensitivity_loop64.csv).

## Discussion
Childhood guidance appears to protect against anxiety and functional impairment but is paradoxically associated with more depression in this sample, a pattern that survives robustness checks and may stem from measurement or reporting biases that deserve deeper qualitative follow-up. Religiosity aligns with self-love and reduced unhappiness, consistent with Koenig (2012) and Martin et al. (2003), while its childhood correlate exerts weaker effects. Current social support interacts with adversity in distinct directions depending on the outcome, aligning partially with Cohen and Wills’s (1985) buffering model: for depression and self-love, support strengthens the protective gradient, whereas for anxiety and unhappiness the gradient steepens, suggesting that the same support networks may make acute anxiety more salient. These nuanced patterns illustrate that relational resources and risk exposures co-occur in complex ways, corroborating the resilience framework articulated by Repetti et al. (2002) and Bethell et al. (2019).

## Limitations
Religionchildhood is entirely missing from the dataset, so the preregistered control for that childhood religiosity item could not be estimated. Simple slopes and predicted outcomes hold covariates at the analytic means and therefore assume no covariate–moderator interactions beyond those modeled. The positive depression coefficient may signal unmeasured confounding (e.g., socio-temporal changes in reporting) or require non-linear modeling.

## Data and code availability
The analyses are driven by `analysis/run_analysis.py` and its frozen pre-analysis plan (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`, commit 808054d3455621759d730efc215ef02802924ff0). All coefficient plots, regression records, and environment snapshots are archived under `artifacts/` (e.g., `artifacts/h1_coefficients_loop64.png`, `artifacts/regression_records_loop64.csv`, `artifacts/pip_freeze_loop64.txt`). Re-running `python analysis/run_analysis.py --loop-index 64` recreates the outputs.
