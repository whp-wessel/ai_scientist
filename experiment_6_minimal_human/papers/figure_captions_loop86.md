1. **H1 guidance coefficients**: Weighted least-squares βs (±95% CI) for anxiety (`npvfh98`), depression (`wz901dj`), and functional impairment (`kd4qc3z`) regressed on the preregistered guidance index with the full covariate set; see `artifacts/h1_coefficients_loop86.png`.
2. **H2 religiosity coefficients**: Parallel regression coefficients (±95% CI) for current and external religiosity predicting relationship satisfaction (`hp9qz6f`), self-love (`2l8994l`), and unhappiness (`ix5iyv3`), highlighting the self-love signal and the nulls elsewhere; plotted in `artifacts/h2_coefficients_loop86.png`.
3. **H3 interaction coefficients**: Standardized adversity × support estimates (±95% CI) for anxiety, depression, unhappiness, and self-love that show how current support reshapes the emotional legacy of childhood adversity; see `artifacts/h3_coefficients_loop86.png`.
4. **H3 simple slopes**: Predicted outcomes across adversity at support = -1, 0, and +1 while holding covariates at their analytic means, visualizing how support steepens anxiety/unhappiness gradients and flattens depression/self-love; displayed in `artifacts/h3_interaction_loop86.png`.
