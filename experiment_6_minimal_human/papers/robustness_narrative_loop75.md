# Robustness Narrative
1. **Trimmed weights**: Capping weights at the 99th percentile reproduces the H1 coefficients (anxiety β = -0.135, depression β = 0.193, functional impairment β = -0.163) and keeps the H2/H3 estimates within ±0.02 of the main results (`artifacts/sensitivity_trimmed_weights_loop75.csv`).
2. **Alternative composites**: The guidance + playful cohesion index converges on the same H1 signs, while both the “parental verbal/emotional abuse” and “at war with yourself” adversity constructions preserve support-dependent H3 moderation across anxiety, depression, unhappiness, and self-love (`artifacts/sensitivity_cohesion_loop75.csv`, `artifacts/sensitivity_adversity_loop75.csv`).
3. **Guidance–depression diagnostics**: The positive guidance → depression coefficient mirrors the raw correlation (r = 0.270), with binned averages archived in `artifacts/guidance_depression_sensitivity_loop75.csv`, suggesting measurement nuance rather than a modeling artifact.
4. **Sample stability**: Analytic sample comparisons and VIF checks (`artifacts/h1_sample_comparison_loop75.csv`, `artifacts/h1_vif_loop75.csv`) show no substantive drift from the full Balanced Childhood Survey panel, supporting the covariate adjustments.
