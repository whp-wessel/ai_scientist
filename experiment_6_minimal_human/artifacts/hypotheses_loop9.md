# Loop 9 Hypothesis Sketches (Literature Phase)

## Hypothesis 1: Religious rigidity/purity culture increases adult distress.
- **Rationale:** Feinson & Meir (2015) show that religiosity can shape the mental health sequelae of childhood abuse; Nica (2019) finds well-being dips among people exiting fundamentalist communities, highlighting the role of rigid religious norms in eroding social support.
- **Variables:** Childhood purity-culture signals (e.g., `wgbq7hv`, `wxgm38d`, `wtolilk`, `gitjzck`), early emotional abuse indicators (`mds78zu`, `v1k988q`), and adult distress outcomes (`npvfh98`, `ix5iyv3`, `wz901dj`, `hp9qz6f`). Control for demographics (age, gender, current religion, education).
- **Proposed test:** Regression models predicting adult distress scales from purity-culture exposure, adjusting for childhood abuse and demographics. Consider latent factor for distress to align with survey structure.

## Hypothesis 2: Parental warmth/guidance predicts adult resilience and satisfaction.
- **Rationale:** Carroll et al. (2013) and Miller-Graff et al. (2016) show that childhood parental warmth buffers long-term biological risk and supports adult functioning even after violence exposure.
- **Variables:** Warmth/guidance indicators (e.g., `pqo6jmj`, `dcrx5ab`, `1k0qepc`, `fnrdtek`, `qnzuq5n`, `i1g8u4j`) and adult well-being items (`2l8994l` self-love, `hp9qz6f` relationship satisfaction, `z0mhd63` career satisfaction). Include childhood adversity controls (abuse, family conflict) and demographic covariates.
- **Proposed test:** Regression or SEM-style models testing whether the warmth composite predicts adult well-being controlling for adversity; check for moderation by baseline adversity (interaction terms).

## Next steps for PAP preparation
1. Define composite scores or scales for purity-culture exposure, parental warmth, and adult distress/satisfaction, specifying item codings and missing-data rules.
2. Pre-register modeling choices (e.g., logistic vs. OLS, use of sampling weights if available).
3. Outline robustness checks (e.g., restraining sample to those who grew up in the same country vs. cross-national variation, controlling for socioeconomic origin).
