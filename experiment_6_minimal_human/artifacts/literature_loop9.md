# Loop 9 Literature Notes

## Dataset Background
- Online survey (n=14,443) with 718 variables covering current well-being, childhood family environment, religious socialization, and demographic/mental health indicators.
- Key thematic areas: childhood religious intensity/purity norms, family climate (support/guidance, humor, abuse), adult psychosocial outcomes (mental health, satisfaction, health), and socio-demographics (class, net worth, education, age, gender identity).

## Candidate Literature
1. Feinson & Meir (2015), *Journal of Interpersonal Violence*: examines intersections of childhood abuse and religiosity in shaping later mental health trajectories.
2. Heiden-Rootes et al. (2019), *Journal of Marital & Family Therapy*: links religious fundamentalism, family acceptance, and depression among sexual minority adults, highlighting mental health strains from doctrinal rigidity.
3. Carroll et al. (2013), *PNAS*: demonstrates parental warmth during childhood buffers against adult biological risk factors (anxiety/stress sequelae) even with early adversity.
4. Nica (2019), *Mental Health, Religion & Culture*: documents well-being challenges for individuals exiting religious fundamentalism, reinforcing how rigid socialization may erode social support and mental health.

## Next Steps
- Translate these strands into hypotheses about childhood religious socialization/purity norms and adult mental health, plus positive family climate and adult well-being.
- Identify precise survey items that operationalize the constructs above for PAP drafting.
