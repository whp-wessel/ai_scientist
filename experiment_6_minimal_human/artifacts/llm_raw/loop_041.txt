**Literature Update**
- Dataset scope: 14,443 respondents × 718 questions capture childhood risk/protective exposures (guidance, abuse, purity messaging), adult well-being scales (anxiety, depression, relationship satisfaction, self-love), and ordinal religiosity/net-worth anchors; the covering notes also flag the need for consistent recoding of `-neg` items so these constructs remain reproducible (analysis/literature_notes.md:4, analysis/literature_notes.md:7, analysis/literature_notes.md:10-12).
- Literature enrichment: appended recent peer-reviewed sources that speak to protective relationships and contextual safeguards—School connectedness (Diggs et al. 2024), early childhood adversity impacts (Alsughier 2024), careful parsing of childcare/adversity (Bosquet Enlow et al. 2024), family-conflict effects in crisis settings (Phạm, Le, & Nguyen 2024), and cultural variance in adult mental health (Copeland et al. 2023)—so we can justify modeling both risks and supportive assets (analysis/literature_notes.md:25; analysis/literature_notes.md:26; analysis/literature_notes.md:27; analysis/literature_notes.md:28; analysis/literature_notes.md:29).
- Hypotheses inventory: finalized three hypotheses linking childhood family cohesion to adult emotional health, religiosity to psychological well-being, and current social support to buffering the adversity–distress gradient, each paired with a clear data plan (exposures/outcomes/covariates) and peer-reviewed justifications such as Cohen & Wills (1985), Cobb et al. (2024), Koenig (2012), and Jung (2017) (analysis/hypotheses.md:3-16).

Next steps
1. Draft the Pre-Analysis Plan, freeze those specifications, and spell out the exact variable constructions, missing-data rules, and modeling choices (linear regressions plus planned interactions) for each hypothesis before entering the analysis phase.
