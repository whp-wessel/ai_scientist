**Loop 74 Release**
- Updated the loop 74 manuscript with the new abstract, literature framing, methods, results, sensitivity narrative, limitations, and reproducibility steps that cite the frozen plan and the latest artifacts (papers/manuscript_loop74.md:1).
- Added figure captions and a robustness narrative that point readers to the loop 74 coefficient plots, interaction figure, and sensitivity tables (papers/figure_captions_loop74.md:1; papers/robustness_narrative_loop74.md:1).
- Logged the analytic snapshot with the latest sample/regression notes and bumped the loop counter to 74 so future runs start from the current release point (artifacts/analysis_loop74_summary.md:1; artifacts/state.json:2).

Testing: `python3 analysis/run_analysis.py --sensitivity --loop-index 74`

Suggestions:
1. Review the new manuscript, captions, and robustness narrative for final polishing before any external release.
2. Consider whether additional sensitivity checks or figures (e.g., alternate interaction visualizations) should accompany the next loop before closing this study.
