**Literature Phase**
- Summarized `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv`: 14,443 respondents, 718 variables, median age 28, mean 30.4, majority US/English-speaking and slightly male-skewed; dataset captures childhood family context (abuse, guidance, class), current life satisfaction, relationship attitudes, and social cues, although the `mentalillness` column was completely missing so I’ll rely on the related attitudinal proxies (e.g., “I tend to suffer from depression,” “I am not happy”) for well-being outcomes. All steps were run in pandas for reproducibility in the working directory.
- Background scoping flagged two promising themes that match the survey content and high-impact literature: (1) childhood adversity/household dysfunction and adult subjective well-being or life satisfaction, and (2) positive family culture/parental guidance during childhood and adult relational satisfaction/social support. These are consistent with the available variables (family abuse flags, parental guidance, adult happiness/satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and social circle quality).
- Key sources to anchor upcoming hypotheses are: Felitti et al. (1998, *American Journal of Preventive Medicine*, DOI 10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8) on Adverse Childhood Experiences and long-term adult health; Umberson & Montez (2010, *Journal of Health and Social Behavior*, 51 Suppl, S54–S66, DOI 10.1177/0022146510383501) on social relationships shaping adult health and well-being; Hazan & Shaver (1994, *Psychological Inquiry*, 5(1), 1–22, DOI 10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1) framing attachment-based continuities into adult close relationships; and Feeney & Collins (2015, *Cambridge Handbook of Personal Relationships*, ch. “Social Support in Close Relationships,” DOI 10.1017/9781316417867.023) describing how early interactions scaffold supportive adult bonds. These citations will anchor each hypothesis when we formalize them.
- Next step: move into the Pre-Analysis Plan phase by freezing the background scoping, selecting dependent/independent variables (e.g., adult happiness/satisfaction versus childhood abuse/parental guidance constructs), and specifying survey-aware estimators, controls, and robustness checks to preregister before running any analysis.
