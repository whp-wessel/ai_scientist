- Expanded `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md` with a reproducibility-first description of the dataset, survey structure, weighting rules, covariate encoding, and documentation expectations so the plan ties directly to the logged snapshot before analyses begin (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:6`).
- Fully specified exposures, outcomes, modeling, and inference for H1, H2, and H3—including the literature anchors, standardization, covariate sets, HC3 robust WLS strategy, and BH-FDR corrections—so preregistration covers the full analytic workflow (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:21`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:29`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:36`).
- Added a robustness/sensitivity checklist plus reporting commitments (figures, tables, effect-size language, and deviation tracking) to keep all downstream work aligned with the plan (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:44`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:52`).
- The plan remains “frozen” (metadata updated accordingly) until we transition to the analysis phase, per the protocol (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`).

Next steps:
1. Re-run `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` to snapshot the weighted sample and distributions, then log the environment/system metadata before modeling.
2. Begin the analysis phase by executing H1’s weighted regressions (and the planned unweighted counterparts), verifying the guidance index and outcomes match the preregistered codings, and documenting sample sizes/missingness to ensure reproducibility.
