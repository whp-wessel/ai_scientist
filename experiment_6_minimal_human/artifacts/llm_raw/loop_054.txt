Loop 54 analysis is done: descriptive context, frozen models, and reproducibility artifacts were generated.

**Loop 54**
- Archived the loop-specific descriptive snapshot (n=14,443, United States leads the sample) and captured the pip-freeze record that anchors this work’s environment for future runs (`artifacts/literature_descriptives_loop54.txt:1`, `artifacts/literature_descriptives_loop54.txt:5`, `analysis_loop54_summary.md:10`).
- H1 shows the guidance index predicts lower anxiety (β=-0.135) and functional impairment (β=-0.163) but is unexpectedly associated with higher depression (β=0.193), all highly significant in the weighted models (`analysis_loop54_summary.md:15`, `analysis_loop54_summary.md:16`, `analysis_loop54_summary.md:17`).
- H2’s current religiosity exposure yields a small positive self-love effect (β=0.037) and negative unhappiness effect (β=-0.034) while relationship satisfaction stays null; childhood/external religiosity produces an even smaller self-love boost (β=0.017) with no reliable effect on unhappiness or satisfaction, as shown in the regression log (`artifacts/regression_records_loop54.csv:4`, `artifacts/regression_records_loop54.csv:5`, `artifacts/regression_records_loop54.csv:6`, `artifacts/regression_records_loop54.csv:7`, `artifacts/regression_records_loop54.csv:8`, `artifacts/regression_records_loop54.csv:9`).
- H3 interaction coefficients differ by outcome (anxiety β=0.070, depression β=-0.049, unhappiness β=0.046, self-love β=-0.041) and simple slopes demonstrate the adversity gradient steepens with higher support (anxiety slope rises from 0.132 at support=-1 to 0.272 at support=1, depression slope steepens in the negative direction) (`analysis_loop54_summary.md:30`, `analysis_loop54_summary.md:31`, `analysis_loop54_summary.md:32`, `analysis_loop54_summary.md:33`, `analysis_loop54_summary.md:34`, `artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop54.csv:2`, `artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop54.csv:4`).
- Limitations noted for this loop include the missing `Religionchildhood` control, simple slopes assuming mean covariates, and dropping `religion` from H2 because it mirrored the active religiosity measures (`analysis_loop54_summary.md:42`, `analysis_loop54_summary.md:43`, `analysis_loop54_summary.md:44`).

**Next Steps**
- Diagnose the unexpected guidance→depression positive coefficient before writing, checking whether scaling or residual confounding is driving the sign (`analysis_loop54_summary.md:16`).
- Prepare for the sensitivity phase by comparing the analytic sample to excluded cases and reviewing VIFs to ensure no multicollinearity surprises emerge as we vary weighting/covariate choices (`analysis_loop54_summary.md:7`, `analysis_loop54_summary.md:8`, `artifacts/h1_sample_comparison_loop54.csv:2`).
- Prime the upcoming writing phase with the H3 simple slopes and predicted supports so that moderation narratives can cite precise slopes/predictions (`artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop54.csv:2`, `artifacts/h3_predicted_supports_loop54.csv:2`).
