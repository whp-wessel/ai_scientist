Reran the frozen analysis pipeline (loop 52) to refresh all hypothesis regressions, capture the reproducible summary, and log the outputs for the analysis phase (`artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:1`).

- Rows with positive weight remain 14,443, and loop 52 created the H1 sample/VIF/regression/environment snapshots plus the H3 simple slopes and predicted-support tables for reproducibility (`artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:5`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:9`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:10`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:36`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:38`).
- The guidance index still correlates with lower anxiety (β=-0.135) and functional impairment (β=-0.163) but shows a positive coefficient for depression (β=0.193), each with p<0.001 (`artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:15`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:17`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:16`).
- Current religiosity is tied to greater self-love (β=0.037) and less unhappiness (β=-0.034) while relationship satisfaction remains flat (β=0.008, p=0.379), and the childhood external religiosity estimates stay small and mostly non-significant (`artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:21`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:22`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:23`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:24`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:25`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:26`).
- The support×adversity interaction is significant across outcomes, positive for anxiety (0.070) and unhappiness (0.046) and negative for depression (-0.049) and self-love (-0.041), documenting how the moderation differs by psychological domain (`artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:31`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:33`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:32`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:34`).
- Limitations noted remain: the `Religionchildhood` column is entirely missing, predictions presume covariates at their analytic means, and the `religion` control was dropped due to collinearity with the active religiosity measures (`artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:42`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:43`, `artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:44`).
- State tracking now records `loop_counter: 52` so the runner knows the analysis stage completed this iteration (`artifacts/state.json:2`).

Next steps:
1. Examine the new H3 simple slopes and predicted-support tables starting at `artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop52.csv:1` and `artifacts/h3_predicted_supports_loop52.csv:1` to translate the moderator effects into the narrative.
2. Use the latest summary (`artifacts/analysis_loop52_summary.md:1`) and the loop 52 coefficient plots (e.g., `artifacts/h1_coefficients_loop52.png`) to begin drafting the results section for the upcoming writing phase.
