**Analysis Update**
- Completed loop 53’s frozen-analysis pass on `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv`, recording the 14,443-person positive-weight snapshot, noting that `Religionchildhood` is entirely missing, and storing sample-comparison, VIF, regression, and environment artifacts for reproducibility while updating the state counter to 53 (`artifacts/analysis_loop53_summary.md#L5`, `#L6`, `#L7`, `#L8`, `#L9`, `#L10`; `artifacts/state.json#L2`).
- H1’s guidance index still predicts lower anxiety and functional impairment (β≈-0.135/β≈-0.163) yet shows a counterintuitive positive association with depression (β≈0.193), so we should double-check the depression coding/orientation despite the other clear protective effects (`artifacts/analysis_loop53_summary.md#L14`, `#L15`, `#L16`, `#L17`).
- H2 finds current religiosity associated with greater self-love and less unhappiness, while relationship satisfaction remains nonsignificant and the childhood religiosity proxy yields smaller/marginal estimates, suggesting the current practice indicator carries most of the signal (`artifacts/analysis_loop53_summary.md#L21`, `#L22`, `#L23`, `#L24`, `#L25`, `#L26`).
- H3’s support × adversity interaction stays robust across anxiety, depression, unhappiness, and self-love, and the saved simple slopes/predicted outcomes (low/average/high support) can guide interpretation of the moderation (`artifacts/analysis_loop53_summary.md#L30`, `#L31`, `#L32`, `#L33`, `#L34`, `#L36`, `#L37`).
- Limitations to flag: no `Religionchildhood` data to include as a covariate, the simple slopes/predicted outcomes assume covariates fixed at their means, and the `religion` control was dropped from H2 because it mirrored the active religiosity measures (`artifacts/analysis_loop53_summary.md#L42`, `#L43`, `#L44`).

Next steps:
1. Double-check the H1 analytic vs. excluded comparison and the VIF table to confirm the complete-case sample and multicollinearity patterns before moving toward sensitivity work (`artifacts/analysis_loop53_summary.md#L7`, `#L8`).
2. Use the regression record snapshot plus the saved H3 simple slopes/predicted-support tables to sketch the upcoming sensitivity checks (e.g., comparing weighted/unweighted estimates and visualizing the moderator slopes) before entering the sensitivity phase (`artifacts/analysis_loop53_summary.md#L9`, `#L36`, `#L37`).
