**Analysis Update**
- Ran the frozen analysis pipeline (`python analysis/run_analysis.py`) for loop 51; the refreshed narrative is in `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:1`, the regression catalog is referenced at `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:9`, and the environment snapshot mentioned at `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:10` is backed by `artifacts/pip_freeze_loop51.txt`.
- The guidance index remains associated with lower anxiety and functional impairment but shows an unexpected positive coefficient for depression (`artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:15`, `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:17`), the analytic sample skews slightly older, less male, and more cis than the excluded respondents (`artifacts/h1_sample_comparison_loop51.csv:2`, `artifacts/h1_sample_comparison_loop51.csv:3`, `artifacts/h1_sample_comparison_loop51.csv:5`), and multicollinearity stays manageable with the highest VIFs (~3.8) for `gendered`/`cis` (`artifacts/h1_vif_loop51.csv:5`, `artifacts/h1_vif_loop51.csv:6`); current religiosity boosts self-love and lowers unhappiness, whereas childhood religiosity remains weaker or nonsignificant (`artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:22`, `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:23`, `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:24`, `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:26`).
- The support × adversity interaction is positive for anxiety/unhappiness and negative for depression/self-love (each outcome has N≈14,030; see `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:31`, `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:33`, `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:32`, `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:34`); the detailed simple slopes and predicted values by support level are saved at `artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop51.csv:2` and `artifacts/h3_predicted_supports_loop51.csv:2`, and the known limitations include the missing `Religionchildhood`, the constant-covariate assumption for slopes, and dropping the `religion` control in H2 (`artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:42`, `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:43`, `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:44`).
- Logged the Python environment (see `artifacts/analysis_loop51_summary.md:10` and `artifacts/pip_freeze_loop51.txt`) and bumped the loop counter to 51 while keeping the phase as `analysis` so downstream loops pick up the new state (`artifacts/state.json:2`).

Tests: `python analysis/run_analysis.py`

Next steps:
1. Double-check the orientation/scaling of the guidance index and the depression outcome so that their signs align with theory before interpreting that positive β.
2. Re-examine the H3 interaction (including alternative support/adversity composites or stratified slopes) to understand why support seems to amplify anxiety/unhappiness but buffer depression/self-love.
