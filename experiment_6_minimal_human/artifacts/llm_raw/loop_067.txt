**Final Release**
- Delivered the full manuscript for the Balanced Childhood Survey (`papers/manuscript_loop66.md:1-38`), which frames the research question, spells out the weighted-LS/H3 modeling, and reports the key effects: guidance lowers anxiety/impairment but unexpectedly ups depression, current religiosity boosts self-love and lowers unhappiness, and support×adversity interactions vary in direction with anxiety/unhappiness versus depression/self-love (all values and CIs are documented in the Results section).  
- The frozen pre-analysis plan (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-60`) anchors the protocol—dataset description, covariates, variable derivations, and H1–H3 hypotheses—ensuring transparency about the constructs (e.g., guidance/adversity/support composites and planned covariate set).  
- Reproducibility is captured in `analysis/run_analysis.py:1-200`, which includes the frozen modeling pipeline, data preparation, and logging helpers; re-running `python analysis/run_analysis.py --sensitivity --loop-index 66` (per `papers/manuscript_loop66.md:16-18`) will regenerate the tables and artifacts archived under `artifacts/` (e.g., `regression_records_loop66.csv`).

Tests:
- Not run (analysis already executed and archived in `artifacts/analysis_loop66_summary.md`).

Next steps:
1. Probe the guidance–depression positive coefficient with nonlinear specifications, subgroup checks, and the diagnostics in `artifacts/guidance_depression_sensitivity_loop66.csv` to see whether measurement heterogeneity or ceiling effects explain the counterintuitive result.
2. Package the finalized figures/robustness narratives from loop 66 (`papers/figure_captions_loop66.md`, `papers/robustness_narrative_loop66.md`) for submission-ready supplements or to guide a targeted preregistered follow-up covering country-specific variation.
