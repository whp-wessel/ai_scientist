- **Dataset** `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` holds 14,443 cases with 718 columns, covering demographics, adult well-being items (e.g., `I tend to suffer from depression (wz901dj)`, `I love myself (2l8994l)`, romantic/work satisfaction) and rich childhood-context battery (e.g., “taught a purity culture that encouraged abstinence/waiting until marriage” for ages 0‑12 and 13‑18, parental guidance/gaming culture, family conflict, parental support).  

- **Literature** Purity/abstinence messaging can create moral tension that interacts with religious coping to shape adult distress—e.g., Barnett et al. (2018) describe how America’s abstinence/purity movement scaffolds moral foundations around sexual behavior (Sexuality & Culture, `10.1007/s12119-017-9467-1`), and Kanter et al. (2025) show that childhood sexual trauma, religious coping, and moral injury jointly predict adult depressive symptoms, pointing to pathways from childhood religiosity to adult mental health (J Relig Health, `10.1007/s10943-025-02481-6`). Family climate in early life (warm guidance vs. risk/conflict) strongly forecasts later mental and physical health, per Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman’s “Risky families” review (Psychological Bulletin, `10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.230`).  

- **Hypotheses**  
  1. Adults who report higher exposure to childhood purity/abstinence teachings (`wgbq7hv`, `wxgm38d`) will report more depressive/anxiety markers (`wz901dj`, `npvfh98`, `ix5iyv3`) and lower self-worth (`2l8994l`, `hp9qz6f`) than peers with less exposure, consistent with moral-injury and religious-coping frameworks.  
  2. Perceived parental support/guidance in childhood (`pqo6jmj`, `dcrx5ab`, `qnzuq5n`, `i1g8u4j`) will predict more favorable adult well-being (higher self-rated health, relationship/work satisfaction, lower depression/anxiety), echoing the “risky families” pathway.  

- **Next** I’ll use this scoping to pre-register the Pre-Analysis Plan, specifying variable operationalizations, modeling approaches (survey-aware regression, covariate controls for age/gender/education), and robustness checks; the PAP will be frozen before moving to empirical testing.
