Scoped the survey and literature so the PAP can build directly on a reproducible dataset description and well-grounded hypotheses.

- Documented the dataset scope (14,443 respondents, 718 columns, top-five countries, and the parental guidance/purity-cultural skew) at `analysis/literature_background.md:4` and keep it reproducible via `analysis/literature_descriptives.py:24`, which prints the row count, country breakdown, religion mix, and the highlighted class/wellbeing columns.
- Anchored the upcoming hypotheses in canonical work including the ACE gradient from `analysis/literature_background.md:10`, the stress-buffering thesis from `analysis/literature_background.md:19`, and the religiosity buffer from `analysis/literature_background.md:20`.
- Summarized the candidate strategies for adversity → distress, support moderation, and religiosity/purity dynamics in `analysis/literature_background.md:24`, `analysis/literature_background.md:25`, and `analysis/literature_background.md:26`, with the corresponding hypotheses spelled out at `analysis/hypotheses_candidates.md:5`, `analysis/hypotheses_candidates.md:9`, and `analysis/hypotheses_candidates.md:13`.

Next steps:
1. Draft the Pre-Analysis Plan by specifying each hypothesis’s dependent and independent variables, controls, and planned estimators (focusing on the abuse, support, and religiosity constructs already scoped).
2. Define analytic decisions—sample restrictions, handling of missingness, and survey weights/clustering—before freezing the PAP so the forthcoming analysis phase can rely on a locked plan.
