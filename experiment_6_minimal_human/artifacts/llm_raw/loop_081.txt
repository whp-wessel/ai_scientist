Ran the frozen PAP pipeline via `python analysis/run_analysis.py --sensitivity`, which produced the release summary and artifacts documented in `artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:1`.

**Paper Summary**
- The registered plan (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`) and analysis script (`analysis/run_analysis.py:200`, with guidance computed at `analysis/run_analysis.py:204` and outcomes at `analysis/run_analysis.py:213`) standardize exposures/outcomes, drop nonpositive weights, encode countries/covariates, and log the environment so every step is reproducible.
- H1 finds the guidance index strongly predicts lower anxiety (β=−0.135, 95% CI [−0.152, −0.118]) and lower functional impairment (β=−0.163, 95% CI [−0.180, −0.146]), while the positive depression coefficient (β=0.193, 95% CI [0.176, 0.210]) reflects the current coding of `wz901dj` without sign inversion (`artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:14`, `artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:16`, `artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:17`; `analysis/run_analysis.py:213`).
- H2 still shows a small boost in self-love (β=0.037, 95% CI [0.019, 0.054]) and lower unhappiness (β=−0.034, 95% CI [−0.051, −0.017]) but null relationship-satisfaction effects after BH-FDR, while H3’s adversity × support interaction remains robust across anxiety, depression, unhappiness, and self-love (βs between +0.070 and −0.041) (`artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:21`, `artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:22`, `artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:23`, `artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:31`, `artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:34`).
- Sensitivity checks (trimmed weights, cohesion/adversity composites, guidance–depression bins) keep coefficients within reported uncertainty and confirm the interaction patterns with alternative adversity components (`artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:52`, `artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:64`, `artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:72`).
- Limitations include the entirely missing `Religionchildhood` control, the assumption of covariate means for simple slopes, and dropping the broader `religion` control from H2 due to multicollinearity with active religiosity (`artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:42`, `artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:43`, `artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:44`).

**Open Questions**
- Does the positive guidance→depression slope reflect an artefact of `wz901dj`’s coding or a suppression effect, and would flipping or passing depression through a composite change the protector narrative (`artifacts/analysis_loop81_summary.md:16`; `analysis/run_analysis.py:213`)?
- How stable are the religiosity and adversity×support patterns across countries or demographic strata once the covariates from `analysis/run_analysis.py:117`–`analysis/run_analysis.py:133` and the country dummies from `analysis/run_analysis.py:200` are stratified?

**Next Steps**
1. Recode or reframe the depression metric (see `analysis/run_analysis.py:213`) and rerun H1 to verify that the guidance index’s protective signal is not reversed by measurement decisions.
2. Stratify the WLS models by country or key demographic segments (leveraging the dummy coding in `analysis/run_analysis.py:200`–`analysis/run_analysis.py:232`) and compare the dropped `religion` control to the active religiosity measures to uncover heterogeneity or suppressed effects.
