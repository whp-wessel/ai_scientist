**Literature Phase**
- *Dataset scope* – `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` contains 14,443 respondents × 718 variables covering demographics, childhood context (e.g., parental guidance, emotional abuse, family class/structure), religiosity (current + childhood), and self-assessments of anxiety/depression/happiness coded mostly on a –3 to +3 scale; I used pandas to capture the shape, example item value counts, and missing-data overview so we can reproduce these starting points going forward.
- *Positive childhood experiences → adult mental health* – the ACE literature (e.g., Felitti et al., 1998; DOI 10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8) and recent analyses of positive/negative childhood experiences (Kuhar, Dorrance-Hall, & Prosen, 2024; “The Effect of Adverse and Positive Childhood Experiences, Attachment, and Emotional Support on Adult Mental Health,” DOI 10.5708/ejmh.19.2024.0031) justify testing whether higher “parents gave useful guidance” and lower “parents emotionally abusive” scores predict lower current “I tend to suffer from depression/anxiety” across adults in our sample.
- *Religiosity & mental health* – meta-analytic work (Abdel-Khalek et al., 2019, *Journal of Religion and Health*, DOI 10.1007/s10943-019-00881-z; Zwingmann, 2025, *Journal of Religion and Health*, DOI 10.1007/s10943-025-02406-3) shows small but reliable links between greater religiosity/spirituality and better mental-health indicators, so I’ll explore how “Do you currently actively practice a religion?” (and stricter childhood religious teaching items) relate to current happiness/depression scores while accounting for childhood context.
- *Next steps* – move into the Pre-Analysis Plan phase for this loop by outlining hypotheses, dependent/independent variables, controls (age, gender, class), statistical models, and planned robustness checks to keep the workflow fully reproducible before “freezing” the PAP.
