**Analysis Update**
- Re-ran `literature_descriptives.py` so the new context snapshot (Rows: 14,443 with country/religion tallies) is archived in `artifacts/literature_descriptives_loop55.txt:1`.
- H1 still shows the guidance index associated with lower anxiety and functional impairment but, unexpectedly, with higher depression (weighted betas = -0.135, -0.163, +0.193; see `analysis_loop55_summary.md:15`, `analysis_loop55_summary.md:17`, `analysis_loop55_summary.md:16`), and the summary also records the analytic sample comparison, VIFs, regression table, and pip-freeze snapshot for reproducibility (`analysis_loop55_summary.md:7`, `analysis_loop55_summary.md:8`, `analysis_loop55_summary.md:9`, `analysis_loop55_summary.md:10`).
- H2 keeps showing small positive self-love effects and negative unhappiness effects for current and childhood religiosity while relationship satisfaction stays null (`analysis_loop55_summary.md:21`, `analysis_loop55_summary.md:22`, `analysis_loop55_summary.md:23`, `analysis_loop55_summary.md:25`, `analysis_loop55_summary.md:26`).
- H3’s support × adversity interaction is significant across outcomes (`analysis_loop55_summary.md:30`, `analysis_loop55_summary.md:31`, `analysis_loop55_summary.md:32`, `analysis_loop55_summary.md:33`, `analysis_loop55_summary.md:34`), with simple slopes showing anxiety’s slope rising from 0.132 at support = -1 to 0.272 at support = 1 and depression’s slope staying negative (see `artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop55.csv:2` and `artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop55.csv:4`), while the associated predictions across support levels are stored at `artifacts/h3_predicted_supports_loop55.csv:2` and `artifacts/h3_predicted_supports_loop55.csv:4`.
- Loop tracking now records counter 55 so the runner knows this analysis pass is complete (`artifacts/state.json:2`).

**Diagnostics**
- The raw Pearson correlation between the guidance index and the depression item is r = 0.270 before any covariate adjustment, whereas guidance still correlates negatively with anxiety (r = -0.205) and functional impairment (r = -0.242), so the surprise is specific to depression rather than a general reversal of guidance → wellbeing (`artifacts/guidance_depression_diag_loop55.md:3`, `artifacts/guidance_depression_diag_loop55.md:4`).

**Next Steps**
1. Investigate the guidance–depression anomaly by re-estimating H1 with alternative covariate sets or operationalizations (e.g., drop or recode religion/class controls) while keeping the diagnostic notes for reference (`artifacts/guidance_depression_diag_loop55.md:3`, `artifacts/guidance_depression_diag_loop55.md:4`).
2. Kick off the sensitivity phase by reviewing the analytic vs. excluded sample and the VIFs saved for this loop to decide which weight/covariate adjustments to test first (`artifacts/h1_sample_comparison_loop55.csv:1`, `artifacts/h1_vif_loop55.csv:1`).
3. Begin drafting the moderation narrative using the stored H3 simple slopes and predicted-support tables, since they now contain the precise values we can cite in writing (`artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop55.csv:1`, `artifacts/h3_predicted_supports_loop55.csv:1`).
