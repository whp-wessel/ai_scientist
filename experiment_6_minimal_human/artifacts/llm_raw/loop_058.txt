**Loop 58 Analysis**
- 14,443 positive-weight observations define the analytic sample, and both the regression snapshot and the pip-freeze archive for loop 58 are saved to support reproducibility (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:5`, `artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:9`, `artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:10`).
- The weighted guidance index is strongly protective: β=−0.135 for anxiety (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:15`), β=−0.193 for depression (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:16`), and β=−0.163 for functional impairment (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:17`), all with BH-adjusted p≈0.
- Current religiosity shows no association with relationship satisfaction (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:21`) but is tied to greater self-love (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:22`) and less unhappiness (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:23`); childhood external religiosity only predicts a small self-love boost (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:25`) while its links to relationship satisfaction and unhappiness remain null (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:24`, `artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:26`).
- The support × adversity interaction is positive for anxiety (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:31`) and unhappiness (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:33`) but negative for depression (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:32`) and self-love (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:34`), and simple slopes show the adversity → anxiety slope steepens from 0.132 at low support to 0.272 at high support (`artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop58.csv:2`, `artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop58.csv:4`) while the depression slope becomes more negative (−0.236 to −0.334) as support rises (`artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop58.csv:5`, `artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop58.csv:7`).
- Limitations remain: the planned `Religionchildhood` control is entirely missing (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:42`), and the `religion` covariate had to be dropped from H2 because it mirrored the active religiosity measures (`artifacts/analysis_loop58_summary.md:44`).
- Testing: `python analysis/run_analysis.py --loop-index 58`.

Next steps: 1) Draft the Results section using the saved coefficients/plots and the summary/regression tables; 2) Begin the sensitivity phase (e.g., alternative cohesion/adversity composites or unweighted comparisons) so we can assess robustness before writing.
