**Literature Phase**
- Completed the background scoping of `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv:1` by running the reproducible `python - <<'PY'` script to log the shape (14,443 respondents × 718 variables) and to inspect distributions for key constructs (`externalreligion`, `classchild/classteen/classcurrent`, liberalism, self-love, depression, romantic satisfaction). That exploration also surfaced the `DtypeWarning` on column 68, so we’ll need to coerce mixed types explicitly when we build the analysis dataset.
- Identified two data-grounded hypotheses with peer-reviewed anchors. First, the multi-wave class items (e.g., `classchild`) plus the adult depressive-symptom item (`I tend to suffer from depression (wz901dj)`) let us test whether lower perceived childhood socioeconomic status predicts higher adult depression even after accounting for current class, echoing the SES–mental health chain described in Chai et al. (2024, *BMC Geriatrics*). Second, the childhood religiosity/purity exposures (`externalreligion`, the “taught a purity culture…” items, etc.) combined with adult well-being signals (self-love, romantic satisfaction) position us to probe whether intense childhood religious socialization is tied to poorer adult psychological outcomes, consistent with Upenieks (2023, *Journal of Religion and Health*) who links early-life religious antecedents to later mental health.
- Next steps: 1) Draft and freeze the Pre-Analysis Plan, specifying the analytic sample, variable construction (e.g., how we’ll code the class ladder and religious socialization indicators), primary outcomes, and control set, and 2) Pre-register the planned handling of missingness/mixed-type columns plus any robustness checks before moving into the analysis phase.
