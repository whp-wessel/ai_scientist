**Literature Phase**
- `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` now confirmed as a 14,443‑respondent, 718‑variable survey with detailed demographics, childhood socialization (0‑12/13‑18 blocks on parental warmth, abuse, religious customs, purity culture, and socioeconomic standing), and adult well‑being metrics (mental health, self‑esteem, relationship/work satisfaction). This structure supports linking retrospective experiences to present outcomes in a reproducible way.
- The dataset’s focus on adverse childhood experiences aligns with the CDC–Kaiser ACE framework (Felitti et al. 1998, *Am J Prev Med*, DOI:10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8), and the “risky families” model of family stress transmission (Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman 2002, *Psychological Bulletin*, DOI:10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.330). Subjective social status measures (e.g., `classchild`, `classteen`, `classcurrent`) pair nicely with evidence linking perceived rank to psychological/physiological functioning (Adler et al. 2000, *Social Science & Medicine*, DOI:10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00093-4). Recent work on childhood emotional abuse and adult mental health (Jung & Soo 2023, *Int J Soc Psychiatry*) further supports probing these links with this survey.
- Candidate hypothesis directions grounded in data and literature:
  1. Higher exposure to childhood emotional and physical abuse items (e.g., `during ages 0-12/13-18: parents verbally/emotionally abusive`, sexual abuse flags) predicts worse adult mental health (anxiety/depression items, `mentalillness`, satisfaction scales), mirroring Felitti et al. (1998) and Jung & Soo (2023).
  2. Greater childhood parental warmth/guidance (e.g., `parents gave useful guidance`, `felt unconditionally loved`, `parents were honest`) associates with stronger adult social satisfaction/self‑esteem, consistent with the “risky families” framework (Repetti et al. 2002).
  3. Lower subjective childhood/teen class status or ongoing economic strain (`classchild`, `classteen`, `networth`, food scarcity) links to poorer adult psychological and physical functioning, aligning with Adler et al. (2000).
- These mappings prepare us to generate a preregistered Pre‑Analysis Plan: next loop I will formalize outcome/exposure definitions, covariates, and analytic strategy (e.g., survey‑aware regression, multiple imputation for missingness) and lock the PAP before analysis.
