Documented loop-24 literature groundwork by rerunning the descriptive script and expanding the background notes with the key peer-reviewed citations that will anchor the hypotheses.

- **Dataset**: Frozen the latest `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` output (14,443 rows; leading countries, religion codes, and means for the class/well-being items) in `analysis/literature_background.md:31-34` so the descriptive benchmarks are fully reproducible for future phases.
- **Literature**: Reinforced the candidate research directions with the foundational sources (Felitti 1998; Umberson & Montez 2010; Koenig et al. 2012; Sheinbaum 2024; Cheng & Furnham 2014; etc.) as captured in `analysis/literature_background.md:10-29` and already referenced in `analysis/hypotheses.md:3-25`, ensuring every hypothesis is grounded in authoritative work.

- Tests: `analysis/literature_descriptives.py`

Next: begin drafting the Pre-Analysis Plan (PAP) for the chosen hypotheses.
