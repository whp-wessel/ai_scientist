Completed the literature-phase scoping: mapped the survey’s breadth, described the analytic sample, and anchored a few research angles in peer-reviewed work to support later hypothesis testing.

- `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv:1` shows 718 columns covering demographics, current well-being, and two sets of “ages 0–12” and “ages 13–18” childhood-experience items (religious messaging, parent behavior, trauma exposures), leaving ample room to link early environments with adulthood outcomes.
- Reproducible `python - <<'PY'` scripts (with `low_memory=False`) produced demographics: 14,443 respondents (mean age 30.4, range 18–75), majority from the U.S./UK/Canada, balanced cis men/women plus nonbinary representation, and a broad spread of education/country/political leanings, which sets the context for weighting or stratification decisions.
- Crossref/Semantic Scholar searches surfaced anchors such as McCormick et al. 2018 (“Adverse childhood experiences, religious/spiritual struggles...” DOI 10.1080/13674676.2018.1440544), Gwin et al. 2018 (“parent–young adult religious concord and depression” DOI 10.1080/19349637.2018.1549524), Musliner & Singer 2014 (“Emotional support and adult depression...,” Child Abuse & Neglect DOI 10.1016/j.chiabu.2014.01.016), and Kuhar et al. 2024 (“The Effect of Adverse and Positive Childhood Experiences...” DOI 10.5708/ejmh.19.2024.0031), providing theory and prior effect sizes for religion, trauma, and buffering experiences.
- Candidate hypotheses for the upcoming PAP: (1) childhood religiosity/purity messaging and internalized religious struggle predict higher adult depression/anxiety and lower relational satisfaction (McCormick et al. 2018; Gwin et al. 2018); (2) emotional/verbal abuse or “being at war with oneself” in childhood predicts adult depression/stress, consistent with Musliner & Singer 2014; (3) positive parental guidance/support during 0–18 moderates adult mental health even after adversity, following Kuhar et al. 2024.

Next steps:
1. Draft the Pre-Analysis Plan by operationalizing these exposures (e.g., religion strictness, parental abuse, parental guidance), outcomes (depression, anxiety, satisfaction), controls, and model/weighting choices, then “freeze” the PAP to respect the loop rules.
2. Lay out derived-variable coding (e.g., create indices from the 0–12/13–18 blocks) and reproducible analytic commands so the subsequent analysis mirrors this literature phase.
