Completed the literature-phase scoping by mapping the available socio-psychological variables onto peer-reviewed theory so we can build hypotheses rooted in both the survey data and the canonical evidence base.

- Dataset scope: the survey has 14,443 responses and ~718 columns that combine demographics (e.g., age, net worth, education), recruitment source (mostly Twitter plus FetLife/Discord/Reddit), childhood contexts (many “during ages 0-12/13-18” Likert items), and adult well-being/relationship scales (mostly −3 to +3), so reproducible work will script column selection, handle the mixed numeric/categorical coding, and document how missingness is treated before modeling.

- Hypothesis 1 (ACEs → adult mental health): more self-reported childhood adversity (e.g., `during ages 0-12: your parents verbally/emotionally abused you (mds78zu)` or `during ages 13-18: Parents divorcing/separating (o47i7yr)`) will predict elevated adult depression/anxiety indicators (`I tend to suffer from depression (wz901dj)`, `I tend to suffer from anxiety (npvfh98)-neg`). This is motivated by Felitti et al. (1998, *American Journal of Preventive Medicine*) and the Lancet Public Health ACEs meta-review (Hughes et al., 2017) showing cumulative household dysfunction predicts adult mental health.

- Hypothesis 2 (supportive parenting → self-esteem/resilience): higher ratings on `during ages 0-12: Your parents gave useful guidance (pqo6jmj)` and lower ratings on `during ages 0-12: you felt at war with yourself (wtolilk)` should correlate with stronger adult self-regard (`I love myself (2l8994l)`, `On average, I am happier as an adult than I was in childhood (h33e6gg)`). Theory comes from Rohner & Britner’s (2002, *Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology*) review of parental warmth/self-esteem and the authoritative parenting literature (e.g., Baumrind, 1991, *Developmental Psychology*).

- Hypothesis 3 (current social support → well-being): more positive social-circle assessments (e.g., `In general, people in my *current* social circles tend to treat me really well (tmt46e6)` / `My friendships often end due to fights or disagreements (etzc5r8)`) will be associated with higher romantic/work satisfaction and lower stress indicators. This links to the buffering model of social support (Cohen & Wills, 1985, *Psychological Bulletin*) and Thoits’ (2011, *Journal of Health and Social Behavior*) synthesis on social ties and health.

Next steps:
1. Draft and freeze the Pre-Analysis Plan, specifying the outcome/mediator variables, covariates, operationalizations of the childhood/adult constructs, planned survey-weighting or sample restrictions, and the statistical models (e.g., linear regression plus robustness checks for scale coding).
2. Once the PAP is frozen, move into analysis by scripting the cleaning steps, creating composite ACE/parental support scales, and registering the exact tests/multiple-comparison adjustments so we stay reproducible.
