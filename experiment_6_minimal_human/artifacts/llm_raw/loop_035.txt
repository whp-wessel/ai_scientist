**Literature Phase**
- Confirmed the sample structure with `python analysis/literature_descriptives.py`, capturing the 14,443 rows, top-country breakdown, ordinal religion codes, and repeated wellbeing/class summaries so we can reproduce these descriptors later (`analysis/literature_background.md:3-11`).
- Expanded the dataset overview with geographic clusters, religiosity spread, and net-worth tails so future loops have a precise sense of the population composition and variable distributions (`analysis/literature_notes.md:3-12`).
- Locked in four peer-reviewed, data-grounded hypotheses (abuse → distress, support-buffering, religiosity/protection, SES/guidance → outcomes) along with candidate operationalizations for each (`analysis/hypotheses_candidates.md:1-19`).

Next steps
1. Draft the Pre-Analysis Plan by formalizing variable definitions, modeling strategies, and covariates for each hypothesis.
2. Freeze the PAP and prepare for the analysis phase (survey-aware modeling of the hypothesized relationships).
