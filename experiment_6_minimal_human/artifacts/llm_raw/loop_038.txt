- Framed this loop’s literature phase by rerunning `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` for a reproducible descriptive anchor and appending a “Loop 38 literature synthesis” section in `analysis/literature_background.md:54-57` that ties the adversity/parental support/religiosity themes to Felitti et al. (1998), Repetti et al. (2002), Cohen & Wills (1985), Koenig et al. (2012), Jung (2017), Košárková et al. (2020), Piper et al. (2022), and Schooler et al. (2005), so the upcoming hypotheses are grounded in authoritative sources.
- Documented methodological guardrails for the PAP in `analysis/literature_background.md:59-62`, noting the survey’s cross-sectional design, Western-heavy sample, and the need to preregister explicit recoding/missing-data rules for `-neg` items, the sparse support question, and textual scales so future loops can reproduce the derived variables with fidelity.
- Tests: `python analysis/literature_descriptives.py`.
- Next steps: 1) Draft and freeze the Pre-Analysis Plan by specifying exposures (e.g., childhood abuse/parental guidance/religiosity), outcomes (adult depression/anxiety, self-love, relationship satisfaction), covariates (age, gender/cis indicators, class, region), and analysis strategy (survey-aware regressions with planned interactions/mediation); 2) Encode the exact recoding, ordinalization, and missing-data thresholds for the key scales in the PAP so later phases can reconstruct the data-processing pipeline.
