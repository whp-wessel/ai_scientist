**Literature Update**
- Documented the survey scope (N=14,443, 718 items, Likert-coded psychosocial and childhood exposure measures) along with candidate exposures/outcomes and coding notes for future preprocessing in `analysis/literature_notes.md:3`.
- Summarized the peer-reviewed literature that grounds the focus on childhood cohesion and religiosity (Cobb et al. 2024; Koenig 2012), satisfying the “at least one authoritative source per hypothesis” requirement in `analysis/literature_notes.md:11`.
- Formalized two hypotheses—childhood family cohesion protecting adult emotional health, and religiosity enhancing psychological well-being—complete with candidate variables and control sets in `analysis/hypotheses.md:3`.

Next steps:
1. Translate these hypotheses into a detailed Pre-Analysis Plan (operational definitions, planned estimators, covariates, handling of missing data, and how to “freeze” the PAP for subsequent phases).
2. Implement reproducible preprocessing scripts (scale recoding, missingness checks, analytic variable construction) so the PAP can cite concrete data preparations when we move to the analysis phase.
