**Literature Phase**
- Survey scoping: `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` is a 14,443‑respondent, 718‑column cross‑section of childhood and adult social/psychological characteristics; key predictors include the two Likert items “during ages *0‑12*: taught a purity culture that encouraged abstinance/waiting until marriage (wgbq7hv)” and the parallel 13‑18 item (wxgm38d), both of which span what looks like a −3…3 agree/disagree range and already show substantial variation, while outcomes such as “I tend to suffer from depression (wz901dj)”, “I love myself (2l8994l)”, and “I am not happy (ix5iyv3)‑neg” tap adult affect and well‑being, so we can directly connect childhood messaging to self‑reported mental health constructs. All steps so far (data loading, value counts, etc.) are scripted in Python to keep the workflow reproducible.
- Background framing: recent work on moral foundations and social norms (Eriksson et al. 2025, *Communications Psychology*, DOI:10.1038/s44271-025-00324-4) situates purity‑based moralizing as a binding foundation that varies across societies and suppresses permissive attitudes; Kanter et al. (2025, *Journal of Religion and Health*, DOI:10.1007/s10943-025-02267-w) links internalized purity‑culture beliefs to moral injury, religious/spiritual struggles, and psychological distress among survivors of intimate partner sexual violence, underscoring that purity messaging functions as a socio‑cognitive stressor rather than a neutral value; and long-standing meta‑analytic evidence (Norman et al. 2012, *PLoS Medicine*, DOI:10.1371/journal.pmed.1001349) documents emphatically that childhood emotional/physical abuse predicts worse adult mental health trajectories, so we can anchor hypotheses in both cultural psychology and trauma literatures.
- Hypotheses:
  1. Greater childhood exposure to parental purity culture teachings (0‑12 and 13‑18 questions) is associated with higher adult psychological distress/lower self‑love and happiness, controlling for key demographics; Kanter et al. (2025) shows purity culture beliefs amplify moral injury and distress, so we expect a measurable negative effect on the well‑being items above.
  2. Higher reported childhood verbal/emotional abuse (e.g., “your parents verbally or emotionally abused you” at 0‑12 and 13‑18) predicts worse adult affective outcomes (e.g., “I tend to suffer from depression”), consistent with Norman et al. (2012)’s systematic review of abuse → adult mental health.
- These hypotheses are aligned with the dataset’s structure and provide a clean hand‑off into a pre‑analysis plan that will define covariates, coding conventions (e.g., treating the −3…3 scales as ordered), and survey‑aware estimators.

**Next Steps**
- Move into the Pre‑Analysis Plan: operationalize exposures/outcomes, specify covariates (age, gender identity, socioeconomic baseline), outline handling of missingness and potential weighting/cluster adjustments, and declare the primary statistical models and robustness checks; once that PAP is finalized and “frozen,” we can enter the analysis phase.
