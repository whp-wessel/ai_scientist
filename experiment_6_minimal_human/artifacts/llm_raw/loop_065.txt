Drafted the writing-phase deliverables and transitioned the state tracker into the release phase.

- **Manuscript draft** now covers the study motivation, data/preprocessing, modeling choices, H1–H3 results, sensitivity write-up, and discussion of nuance/limitations (`papers/manuscript_loop65.md:1`, `papers/manuscript_loop65.md:9`, `papers/manuscript_loop65.md:19`, `papers/manuscript_loop65.md:29`, `papers/manuscript_loop65.md:32`).
- **Figure captions** summarize each plot, linking the H1/H2 coefficients and the H3 interaction/simple-slope visuals stored in `artifacts/` (`papers/figure_captions_loop65.md:1`).
- **Robustness narrative** documents the trimmed weights, alternative composites, guidance–depression diagnostics, and sample stability checks with artifact references (`papers/robustness_narrative_loop65.md:1`).
- **State update** marks the loop counter at 65 and advances the workflow to the release phase so future loops can run in that stage (`artifacts/state.json:1`).

Tests: Not run (not requested).

Next steps:
1. Begin the release-phase work (e.g., finalize release documentation or appendices that package the manuscript, captions, and robustness write-up).
2. Confirm that the release-phase loop includes any remaining archiving or presentation staples (e.g., a short executive summary or README pointing to the preserved artifacts).
