Loop 56 reran the descriptives plus the frozen pipeline; the new summary records 14,443 positive-weight respondents and points to the refreshed regression/VIF outputs for reproducibility (`artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:5`, `artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:9`).  

- Guidance index reduces anxiety (β=-0.135, 95% CI [-0.152, -0.118]) and functional impairment (β=-0.163, 95% CI [-0.180, -0.146]) but is unexpectedly associated with higher depression (β=0.193, 95% CI [0.176, 0.210]), so we should verify whether the depression scale’s direction matches the rest of the construct (`artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:15`, `artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:16`, `artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:17`).  
- Current religiosity (902tbll) predicts greater self-love (β=0.037, 95% CI [0.019, 0.054]) and lower unhappiness (β=-0.034, 95% CI [-0.051, -0.017]) while relationship satisfaction stays null; external religiosity has a marginal positive association with self-love (β=0.017, 95% CI [0.000, 0.034]) but no reliable link to unhappiness or relationship satisfaction, suggesting active practice is the stronger signal (`artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:21`, `artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:22`, `artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:23`, `artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:24`, `artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:25`, `artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:26`).  
- The support × adversity interaction is significant in all models but with opposite signs across outcomes (positive for anxiety/unhappiness, negative for depression/self-love), and simple slopes show the adversity→anxiety slope climbs from 0.132 to 0.272 as support rises while the adversity→depression slope becomes more negative (−0.333 at high support), pointing to complex moderation that needs conceptual unpacking (`artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:31`, `artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:32`, `artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:33`, `artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:34`, `artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop56.csv:3`, `artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop56.csv:6`, `artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop56.csv:9`, `artifacts/h3_simple_slopes_loop56.csv:12`).  

Limitations include the complete missingness of `Religionchildhood`, the assumption that simple slopes/predictions hold covariates at their means, and the necessary dropping of the overall `religion` control to avoid redundancy with the religiosity exposures (`artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:42`, `artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:43`, `artifacts/analysis_loop56_summary.md:44`). The loop counter is now 56 in `artifacts/state.json:2`, so the state reflects this pass.

Next steps:  
1. Double-check the coding/orientation of `wz901dj` (depression) and the adversity components so we understand why guidance is positively associated with depression and support intensifies adversity for some outcomes before running further robustness checks.  
2. Begin the planned sensitivity phase: test alternative adversity composites, re-estimate with and without weights, and explore sample restrictions or imputation strategies to confirm the stability of H1–H3 signals before writing up the paper.
