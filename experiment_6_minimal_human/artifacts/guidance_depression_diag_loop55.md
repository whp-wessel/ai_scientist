# Loop 55 diagnostic notes

- Raw (unadjusted) Pearson correlation between the guidance index and the depression item is **r = 0.270** based on the 14,443 respondents with positive weights, so the positive coefficient is present before any covariate control.
- Guidance correlates negatively with anxiety (r = -0.205) and functional impairment (r = -0.242), indicating that the unexpected pattern is specific to depression rather than a general reversal of the guidance–wellbeing relationship.
