# Loop 11 Literature Notes

## Dataset background and scoping
- `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` still contains 14,443 complete records and 718 variables spanning demographics, childhood socialization, worldview/values, and adult well-being. The script at `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` reproduces the summaries below.
- Subjective class experiences stretch from 0 (low) to 6 (high) with means of 2.62 (`classchild`), 2.76 (`classteen`), and 3.02 (`classcurrent`), suggesting a broadly middle-class sample with enough variance for gradients.
- Respondent distribution is dominated by the United States (7,498), followed by the United Kingdom (1,191), Canada (963), Australia (545), and Western Europe (443). Religiosity codes are mostly non-religious (value 0, n=9,958) with substantial minorities coded 1-3 for different faith backgrounds.
- Adult well-being proxies sit near the scale midpoints: `I love myself` has mean 0.61 (SD 1.86), `I am not happy` mean 0.15 (SD 1.98), and `work/career satisfaction` mean 0.12 (SD 2.04). Childhood guidance (0-12) averages 0.63 while purity-culture teaching (0-12) clusters around -0.22, indicating mixed experiences of rigid moral instruction.

## Candidate literature
1. **Reiss (2013, *Social Science & Medicine*, 90:24–31, doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.04.026)** documents that childhood socioeconomic disadvantage predicts adult depression and anxiety after adjusting for family and individual covariates, supporting the use of `classchild` as a social-class predictor.
2. **Norman et al. (2012, *PLoS Medicine*, 9(11):e1001349, doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1001349)** meta-analyze multiple forms of maltreatment and find emotional abuse carries sustained odds ratios for adult depression/anxiety independent of socioeconomic status.
3. **Nica (2019, *Mental Health, Religion & Culture*, 22(10), doi:10.1080/13674676.2019.1636015)** shows that exiting religious fundamentalism—often after purity-culture socialization—requires rebuilding social support and is associated with ongoing psychological distress, validating the focus on purity teaching items.
4. **Masten (2001, *American Psychologist*, 56(3):227–238, doi:10.1037/0003-066X.56.3.227)** characterizes parental guidance and warmth as core protective factors that generate resilience even when adversity is present, justifying our interest in the `parents gave useful guidance` items.

## Candidate hypotheses (grounded in the available data + literature)
1. **Childhood socioeconomic position and adult mental-health steepness.** Lower `classchild` values will relate to worse adult well-being (`I love myself`, `I am not happy`, `work/career satisfaction`). Reiss (2013) argues that the social-class gradient persists over decades, so these subjective class ratings provide a testable proxy.
2. **Emotional/verbally abusive parenting predicts adult distress.** Negative scores on `during ages *0-12*: your parents verbally or emotionally abused you` and its teen counterpart will align with worse adult outcomes (higher `I tend to suffer from anxiety`, higher `I am not happy`). Norman et al. (2012) shows these forms of abuse predict adult psychopathology even net of class.
3. **Purity-culture teaching reduces adult self-love and increases anxiety.** Higher agreement with `taught a purity culture that encouraged abstinence/waiting until marriage` (ages 0-12 and 13-18) should associate with lower `I love myself` and higher `I tend to suffer from anxiety`. Nica (2019) describes the psychological costs of exiting such strict moral regimes.
4. **Parental guidance buffers adult self-concept and work satisfaction.** Positive scores on `Your parents gave useful guidance` (both childhood and teen windows) will predict higher `I love myself` and career satisfaction. Masten (2001) frames supportive parenting as a resilience factor that facilitates adaptive adult functioning.

## Reproducibility and next steps
- The descriptive statistics above are generated by `analysis/literature_descriptives.py`, which reads the CSV with `low_memory=False` and prints key country, religiosity, and numeric summaries. Re-running this script ensures the counts/means remain consistent as we prep the pre-analysis plan.
- Next loop: translate these hypotheses into precise estimands, operationalize treatment/outcome variables, and begin drafting the Pre-Analysis Plan (PAP) so we can freeze it before moving to analysis.
