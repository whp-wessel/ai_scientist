# Loop 16 Literature Notes

## Dataset background and scoping
- `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` still contains 14,443 respondents across 718 columns; ingesting it with `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` (which leverages `pandas.read_csv(..., low_memory=False)`) reproduces this row count plus the key summaries below.
- The sample remains dominated by the United States (7,498 respondents) followed by the United Kingdom (1,191), Canada (963), Australia (545), and Western Europe (443); religion codes remain skewed toward the “none” category (0.0, n=9,958) but with sizeable faith-based minorities.
- Subjective class metrics progress slightly upward over time (childhood mean 2.62, teen 2.76, current 3.02 on a 0–6 scale), while adult wellbeing anchors near the scale center (`I love myself` mean ≈ 0.61, `I am not happy` mean ≈ 0.15, career satisfaction mean ≈ 0.12). Parental guidance takes on positive mean values (~0.63) and purity-culture teaching skews negative (mean ≈ –0.22), hinting at a mix of supportive and restrictive moralizing experiences.
- The combination of childhood adversity items (e.g., parental verbal/emotional abuse, sexual abuse, purity messaging) and adult self-concept/wellbeing items positions the dataset well for testing retrospective adversity-to-wellbeing pathways while accounting for protective family and religious supports.

## Candidate literature
1. **Felitti et al. (1998, *American Journal of Preventive Medicine* 14(4):245–258, DOI:10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8)** document graded links between adverse childhood experiences and adult medical/mental-health risk, motivating the treatment of childhood abuse indicators as core exposures.
2. **Umberson & Montez (2010, *Journal of Health and Social Behavior* 51(Suppl):S54–S66)** demonstrate that enduring social relationships (family, parental support) buffer mental-health risk over the life course, supporting the inclusion of parental guidance and current relational satisfaction as protective components.
3. **Koenig, King, & Carson (2012, *Handbook of Religion and Health*, Oxford Univ. Press)** synthesize decades of work connecting religiosity to lower depression and higher wellbeing, justifying the use of religiosity/religious-practice variables as moderators/protective factors.
4. **Cohen & Wills (1985, *Psychological Bulletin* 98(2):310–357, DOI:10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.310)** articulate the stress-buffering hypothesis of social support, which informs modeling interactions between childhood adversity and current support (e.g., `In general, people in my current social circles tend to treat me really well (tmt46e6)`).

## Candidate hypotheses
1. **Childhood abuse predicts adult depression/anxiety.**
   - Exposures: `during ages *0-12*: your parents verbally or emotionally abused you (mds78zu)`, `during ages *13-18*: your parents verbally or emotionally abused you (v1k988q)`, sexual-abuse indicators such as `during ages *0-12*: a household member sexually abused you in a way included genital penetration or envelopment (949atsn)`.
   - Outcomes: high `I am not happy (ix5iyv3)-neg`, high `I tend to suffer from depression (wz901dj)`, high `I tend to suffer from anxiety (npvfh98)-neg`.
   - Direction: more abuse → more negative affect, replicating the ACE gradient from Felitti et al. (1998).
2. **Parental guidance and religious practice buffer adult self-regard and relational satisfaction.**
   - Exposures: `during ages *0-12*: Your parents gave useful guidance (pqo6jmj)`, `during ages *13-18*: Your parents gave useful guidance (r6x5c83)`, and `Do you currently actively practice a religion? (902tbll)` ordinal coding.
   - Outcomes: `I love myself (2l8994l)` and `I am satisfied with my romantic relationships (hp9qz6f)` capture positive self-concept and social wellbeing.
   - Direction: stronger guidance and religious engagement → higher self-love/relationship satisfaction, consistent with Umberson & Montez (2010) and Koenig et al. (2012).
3. **Current social support moderates the adversity–wellbeing link.**
   - Exposures: abuse index (as above), moderator `In general, people in my current social circles tend to treat me really well (tmt46e6)`.
   - Outcomes: self-love, happiness/anxiety items, career satisfaction.
   - Direction: consistent with Cohen & Wills (1985), higher current support should attenuate the estimated effect of childhood abuse on adult wellbeing.

## Reproducibility and next steps
- All descriptive statistics above are generated by `analysis/literature_descriptives.py` and should be rerun before the next phase to confirm that the dataset state has not changed.
- Next loop: translate these hypotheses into precise estimands, operationalize key independent/dependent/control variables, and begin drafting the Pre-Analysis Plan so it can be frozen before moving to analysis.
