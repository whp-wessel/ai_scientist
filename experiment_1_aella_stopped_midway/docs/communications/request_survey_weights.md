# Draft Request: Survey Design Weights Documentation

**To:** Data Provider Contact (TBD)  
**From:** Research Team — Childhood Wellbeing Study  
**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Subject:** Request for Official Survey Weights and Design Metadata

## Message Draft

> Dear [Contact Name],
>
> I hope you are well. I am writing on behalf of the research team analyzing the Childhood Balanced Public Survey (file: `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv`). We are developing design-based estimators and confirmatory analyses that require the official survey weights and sampling design documentation.
>
> We would greatly appreciate your help in providing:
> 1. Final person-level weights (base and calibrated, if available) with variable names.
> 2. Replicate weights or bootstrap/jackknife specifications, if supplied.
> 3. Stratification and clustering identifiers, including any multi-stage sampling details.
> 4. Fieldwork notes describing response rate adjustments or non-response weighting corrections.
>
> If documentation exists (technical report, codebook appendix, or weighting memo), a PDF or URL would be perfect. Our reproducibility protocol requires us to cite the official source and align estimands with the published design.
>
> Please let us know if there are confidentiality steps or data-use agreements that we should complete before receiving these materials. We are happy to schedule a brief call if discussing details synchronously is easier.
>
> Thank you for your time and assistance. We look forward to collaborating and will gladly share our methodological notes once analyses are complete.
>
> Best regards,
>
