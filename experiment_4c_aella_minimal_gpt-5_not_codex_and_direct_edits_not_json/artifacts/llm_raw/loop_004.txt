**Loop Summary**
- Stayed in literature phase; advanced reproducibility and public outputs.
- Attempted Semantic Scholar search (captured 429 without API key).
- Added a privacy-safe public cross-tab table (religion x monogamy).
- Updated logs, notebook, state, and requested a commit.

**Artifacts Updated**
- Decision log appended: analysis/decision_log.csv:18
- Notebook updated with Loop 004: notebooks/research_notebook.md:61
- Paper mentions new public table: reports/paper.md:25
- New public table: tables/religion_by_monogamy.csv:1
- S2 query artifact (rate-limited): lit/queries/loop_004/query_001.json:1
- State updated: artifacts/state.json:3
- Commit request: artifacts/git_message.txt:1
- New helper for safe tables: scripts/analysis/make_tables.py:1

**Commands Run**
- S2 search (unauthenticated; 1 rps enforced):
  - `python scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py search --query "childhood religion religiosity adult wellbeing mental health" --limit 5 --output lit/queries/loop_004/query_001.json`
- Public cross-tab (n<10 suppression):
  - `python scripts/analysis/make_tables.py --input childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv --var1 religion --var2 monogamy --output tables/religion_by_monogamy.csv --threshold 10`

**Rigor & Invariants**
- Reproducibility: Commands and seed recorded in decision log; state advanced to loop 4.
- Privacy: All public cells with n<10 are masked (“<10”).
- Design: No weights/strata/clusters; SRS justification maintained in analysis/results.csv and PAP.
- Multiplicity: No confirmatory families yet; q-values not applicable.

**Next Steps**
- Add `.env` with `S2_API_Key` so the S2 helper can return results; on success, extract DOIs (from `externalIds.DOI`) into `lit/evidence_map.csv`.
- Consider ordinal/robust models and sensitivity notes draft.

If you want, I can proceed to implement a tiny extractor to pull DOIs from successful S2 JSON into `lit/evidence_map.csv` once the key is added.
