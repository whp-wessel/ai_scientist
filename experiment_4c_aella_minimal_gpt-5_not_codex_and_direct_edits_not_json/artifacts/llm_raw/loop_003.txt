Loop 003 complete. I added exploratory modeling, refreshed EDA, and persisted a literature query attempt with structured logging.

**What I Did**
- Implemented minimal OLS modeling from hypotheses and generated results.
- Updated PAP to the exact modeling command; refreshed EDA to align key vars.
- Attempted a Semantic Scholar search via the helper; saved structured error (no API key).
- Logged all actions, updated the notebook and paper, and wrote a commit message.

**Key Updates**
- Modeling script: `scripts/analysis/run_models.py` (standardized OLS; SRS assumption).
- PAP command updated: `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:36`.
- Exploratory results appended: `analysis/results.csv`.
- EDA refreshed: `outputs/eda_summary.json`; `tables/key_vars_value_counts.csv` (n<10 masked).
- Semantic Scholar helper now persists HTTP errors; search attempt saved under `lit/queries/loop_003/query_002.json`.
- Notebook: `notebooks/research_notebook.md` (Loop 003 section).
- Paper: `reports/paper.md` (brief exploratory summary).
- State and log: `artifacts/state.json` (loop_counter=3), `analysis/decision_log.csv` (3 new rows).
- Commit request: `artifacts/git_message.txt`.

**Exploratory Results (pointers)**
- Full rows: `analysis/results.csv:1`.
- Highlights (standardized OLS, not confirmatory):
  - H3: Teen SES positively associated with depression and stress items (p≈0).
  - H4: Male indicator positively associated with anxiety item (p≈0).
  - H2: Religion positively associated with monogamy preference; near-zero for relationship satisfaction.
  - H1: Childhood religious strictness ~ adult unhappiness near zero.

**Literature Query**
- Helper run (unauthenticated): `scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py search --query "childhood religion religiosity adult wellbeing mental health" --limit 5 --output lit/queries/loop_003/query_002.json`
- Result: 429 rate limit without key. Error saved to `lit/queries/loop_003/query_002.json`.

**Privacy**
- Public table `tables/key_vars_value_counts.csv` masks cells with n<10.

**Next Actions**
- Provide `.env` with `S2_API_Key` and rerun the saved query; then extract DOIs into `lit/evidence_map.csv`.
- Consider ordinal/logistic models and robustness checks; plan sensitivity phase steps.
- If promoting any hypothesis family to confirmatory, freeze PAP and control FDR.

If you’d like, I can proceed to add DOI extraction into `lit/evidence_map.csv` once the API key is available, or start drafting sensitivity analyses.
