DECISION: CONTINUE

R1 Reproducibility: PASS — Seed logged (`artifacts/seed.txt`), environment captured (`artifacts/session_info.txt`), actions/commands recorded (`analysis/decision_log.csv`), deterministic scripts present (`scripts/analysis/eda.py`, `scripts/analysis/run_models.py`), outputs reproducible (`analysis/results.csv`, `outputs/eda_summary.json`).

R2 Statistical Rigor: PASS — Survey design handled via SRS with explicit justification (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`, `analysis/results.csv:srs_justification`); all rows `confirmatory=false`; families assigned; effects reported with SE/CI/p (`analysis/results.csv`); no q-values required yet.

R3 Literature/Evidence: WARN — Minimal but present: DOI logged in `lit/evidence_map.csv` and cited in `reports/paper.md`. Semantic Scholar queries attempted via helper with structured errors saved (`lit/queries/loop_000/query_002.json`, `lit/queries/loop_003/query_002.json`) pending `.env` API key.

R4 Privacy: PASS — Public table masks n<10 as “<10” (`tables/key_vars_value_counts.csv`); non-public EDA lives under `outputs/`.

R5 Completeness: PASS — Required artifacts exist (`analysis/*`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md`, `reports/paper.md`, `lit/*`, `tables/*`); PAP is `status: draft` with freeze protocol noted; no confirmatory results yet.

Notes: Provide `.env` `S2_API_Key` to advance literature; consider adding `artifacts/git_message.txt` to request a commit.
