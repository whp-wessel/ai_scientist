DECISION: CONTINUE

- R1 Reproducibility: PASS — Seeds logged (`artifacts/seed.txt`), commands recorded in `analysis/decision_log.csv` (e.g., EDA), and regenerable code present (`scripts/analysis/eda.py`). Outputs exist (`outputs/eda_summary.json`, `tables/key_vars_value_counts.csv`).
- R2 Statistical Rigor: PASS — No confirmatory tests yet; SRS explicitly justified in `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md` and `config/survey_design.yaml`. FDR plan noted. No effect estimates reported yet; `analysis/results.csv` header prepared.
- R3 Literature/Evidence: WARN — One citable source with DOI in `lit/bibliography.bib` and mapped in `lit/evidence_map.csv`. Semantic Scholar query artifacts are placeholders (`lit/queries/loop_000/query_001.json`) due to missing `S2_API_Key`; helper exists (`scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py`) but query not executed.
- R4 Privacy: PASS — Public table `tables/key_vars_value_counts.csv` masks cells with n<10 (“<10”), meeting the small-cell rule.
- R5 Completeness: WARN — Core artifacts present (`analysis/*`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md`, `reports/paper.md`, `lit/*`, `tables/*`). However, `artifacts/git_message.txt` is missing (no commit request logged). `analysis/results.csv` has no rows yet (acceptable at this phase).

Notes: Add `.env` with `S2_API_Key` and run the saved search to populate `lit/queries/*` and update `lit/evidence_map.csv`. Write a commit message to `artifacts/git_message.txt` to checkpoint this loop.
