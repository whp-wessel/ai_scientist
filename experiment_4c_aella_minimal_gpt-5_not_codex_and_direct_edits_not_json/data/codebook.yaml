# TODO: Codebook placeholder
# No codebook was provided with the dataset `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv`.
# Action: During the literature phase, infer variable types/scales from headers and values,
# and formalize a proper codebook here. Until then, analyses will treat Likert-like
# items as ordinal numeric where applicable and document any coercions.
