,H1,childhood_emotional_support,TRUE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","Confirmatory family (tag `pap_freeze_loop006`) contains only the H1 moderation contrasts extracted from `tables/loop004_h1_diagnostics.csv`: (a) abuse × guidance buffering (`abuse_child_guidance_int` > 0) and (b) abuse × male interaction (`abuse_child_male_int` < 0). Commands + seed recorded in the frozen PAP; main-effect contrasts remain exploratory."
,H2,parental_guidance_self_regard,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","More parental guidance ages 0-12 (pqo6jmj) associates with higher adult self-love scores (2l8994l); aligned z-scores ensure higher values mean more guidance/self-love."
,H3,childhood_class_networth,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","Respondents from higher childhood socioeconomic class (classchild) report higher current net worth (networth) when modeled via partial proportional-odds logits across all 10 brackets. Cluster bootstraps (`tables/loop014_h3_bootstrap_summary.csv`) show near-zero slopes at ≥$100k/≥$1M but a positive, if noisy, signal at ≥$10M; Loop 016 added the power summary + confirm shell (`tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv`, `tables/loop016_h3_confirmatory.csv`) showing a design effect of 14.8 (effective n≈978) and guiding the proposed single-test confirmatory family (`childhood_class_networth_ge10m`)."
,H3_ge10m,childhood_class_networth_ge10m,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","Loop 017 decision: keep the ≥$10M PPO slope exploratory until we can pool additional survey waves or obtain cluster design metadata; despite an analytic p-value of 0.0024, the cluster bootstrap SD=0.140 implies a design effect of 14.8 and power of only 0.16 (`tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv`)."
,H4,religiosity_and_anxiety,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","Currently practicing a religion (religion) associates with lower anxiety frequency (npvfh98), and the preregistered promotion draft focuses on the moderate practice × childhood class interaction on the high-anxiety flag logit (`tables/loop015_h4_interactions_rich.csv`, `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv`). Literature now links religiosity-induced resilience to class heterogeneity (Kasen et al., 2014; Davis et al., 2021; Bruce et al., 2024)."
,H4_classgrad,religiosity_class_gradients,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","Two-test candidate family: (a) moderate practice × childhood class interaction (primary) and (b) serious practice × childhood class (supporting) on the ≥5 high-anxiety flag logit. Loop 020 extended the confirmatory shell (`tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv`) to also report the 3-bin ordinal outcome and ran ridge (α=5) and ordinal stress tests (`tables/loop020_h4_stress_test_coeffs.csv`), showing the serious slope remains negative (p_ridge = 0.047, p_ord3 = 0.031). Benjamini–Hochberg control (m=2) therefore still favors keeping the serious contrast inside the proposed family while we finish reviewer sign-off."
