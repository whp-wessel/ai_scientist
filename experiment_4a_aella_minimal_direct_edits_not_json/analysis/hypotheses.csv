,H1,childhood_emotional_support,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","Higher parental emotional abuse ages 0-12 (mds78zu) predicts higher adult self-reported depression (wz901dj). Likert polarity now aligned via `scripts/likert_utils.py`, yet Loop 004 diagnostics (`tables/loop004_h1_*`) reveal the observed slope remains negative overall but is moderated by parental guidance (buffering) and gender (stronger inverse among men); PAP will decide whether to target these interactions."
,H2,parental_guidance_self_regard,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","More parental guidance ages 0-12 (pqo6jmj) associates with higher adult self-love scores (2l8994l); aligned z-scores ensure higher values mean more guidance/self-love."
,H3,childhood_class_networth,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","Respondents from higher childhood socioeconomic class (classchild) report higher current net worth (networth) when modeled via ordered logits across all 10 brackets."
,H4,religiosity_and_anxiety,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","Currently practicing a religion (religion) associates with lower anxiety frequency (npvfh98), tested via aligned anxiety z-scores plus a high-anxiety logit."
