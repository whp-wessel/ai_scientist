,H1,childhood_emotional_support,TRUE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","Confirmatory family (tag `pap_freeze_loop006`) contains only the H1 moderation contrasts extracted from `tables/loop004_h1_diagnostics.csv`: (a) abuse × guidance buffering (`abuse_child_guidance_int` > 0) and (b) abuse × male interaction (`abuse_child_male_int` < 0). Commands + seed recorded in the frozen PAP; main-effect contrasts remain exploratory."
,H2,parental_guidance_self_regard,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","More parental guidance ages 0-12 (pqo6jmj) associates with higher adult self-love scores (2l8994l); aligned z-scores ensure higher values mean more guidance/self-love."
,H3,childhood_class_networth,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","Respondents from higher childhood socioeconomic class (classchild) report higher current net worth (networth) when modeled via ordered logits across all 10 brackets."
,H4,religiosity_and_anxiety,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,"SRS assumed after scanning all 718 headers for 'weight/strata/cluster' (none found beyond the literal body-weight question).","Currently practicing a religion (religion) associates with lower anxiety frequency (npvfh98), tested via aligned anxiety z-scores plus a high-anxiety logit."
