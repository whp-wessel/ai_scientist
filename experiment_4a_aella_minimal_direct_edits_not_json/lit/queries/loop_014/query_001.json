Research into the honor-suicide link has suggested explanatory factors that coincide with the interpersonal theory of suicide, such as untreated depression, heightened risk-taking, and the use of firearms in suicide. Method: The present study exam-ined ambivalent ageism, permissive attitudes toward suicide, and interpersonal risk factors for suicide as explanations for the honor-suicide link among a sample of 201 American men in midlife and above. Results: After controlling for participant age and religiosity, participants with greater endorsement of honor ideology but lower levels of honor fulfillment expressed heightened levels of thwarted belongingness\u2014an established interpersonal risk factor for suicide. Additionally, lower levels of honor fulfillment predicted greater anxiety about aging, greater perceived burdensomeness, and more positive implicit attitudes toward youth. Conversely, greater levels of honor fulfillment also predicted more positive attitudes toward older adults.

      "abstract": "Abstract Prior research has demonstrated that rates of suicide increase as men enter older adulthood and that these rates are even higher in honor-oriented regions of the U.S. (particularly among White men). Research into the honor-suicide link has suggested explanatory factors that coincide with the interpersonal theory of suicide, such as untreated depression, heightened risk-taking, and the use of firearms in suicide; however, factors related to aging (e.g., ageism, anxiety about aging) have yet to be examined. The present study examined ambivalent ageism, permissive attitudes toward suicide, and interpersonal risk-factors for suicide as explanations for the honor-suicide link among a sample of 201 older American men (Mage = 56.45, SD = 8.35, range = 44-77 years of age). After controlling for participant age and religiosity, participants with greater endorsement of honor ideology but lower levels of honor fulfillment expressed heightened levels of thwarted belongingness (\u03b2 = 0.35, p = .001)\u2014an established interpersonal risk-factor for suicide. Additionally, lower levels of honor fulfillment predicted greater anxiety about aging (\u03b2 = -0.41, p < .001), greater perceived burdensomeness (\u03b2 = -0.39, p < .001), and more positive implicit attitudes toward youth (\u03b2 = 0.27, p = .019). Conversely, greater levels of honor fulfillment predicted more positive attitudes toward aging (\u03b2 = 0.20, p = .025). Our results extend previous research on the honor-suicide relationship by demonstrating the utility of marrying the interpersonal theory of suicide with research on cultures of honor.",

      "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment is one of many risk factors for borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, not all individuals with BPD report histories of childhood maltreatment. Therefore, it is necessary to identify factors that contextualize the relation between childhood maltreatment and BPD features. With its emphasis on the developmental origins of emotion regulation, attachment theory provides a useful framework to understand how people are differentially affected by early life stress. The present study examined self-reported adult attachment as a moderator in the relation between childhood maltreatment and BPD features in a large undergraduate sample (n\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0033). Attachment anxiety, but not attachment avoidance, moderated the relation between childhood maltreatment and BPD features, and this relation was non-significant among participants low (-1 standard deviation) in attachment anxiety. These results support the hypothesis that secure attachment in adulthood may buffer against the otherwise deleterious effects of distal risk factors on personality pathology. Future research should continue to examine this question across risk factors and across disorders. Furthermore, we suggest that researchers who have historically examined attachment as a mediator cross-sectionally should re-examine their data for evidence of a moderation effect. \u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
