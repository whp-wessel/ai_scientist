      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective: Loneliness and physical activity are important targets for research into the impact of COVID-19 because they have established links with mental health, could be exacerbated by social distancing policies, and are potentially modifiable. In this study, we aimed to identify whether loneliness and physical activity were associated with worse mental health during a period of mandatory social distancing in the UK. Design: Population-based observational cohort study. Setting: Mental health data collected online during COVID-19 from an existing sample of adults aged 50 and over taking part in a longitudinal study of aging. All had comparable annual data collected between 2015 and 2019. Participants: Three-thousand two-hundred and eighty-one participants aged 50 and over. Measurements: Trajectories of depression (measured by PHQ-9) and anxiety (measured by GAD-7) between 2015 and 2020 were analyzed with respect to loneliness, physical activity levels, and a number of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Results: In 2020, PHQ-9 score for loneliness, adjusted for covariates, was 3.23 (95% CI: 3.01\u20133.44), an increase of around 1 point on all previous years in this group and 2 points higher than people not rated lonely, whose score did not change in 2020 (1.22, 95% CI: 1.12\u20131.32). PHQ-9 was 2.60 (95% CI: 2.43\u20132.78) in people with decreased physical activity, an increase of .5 on previous years. In contrast, PHQ-9 in 2020 for people whose physical activity had not decreased was 1.66, 95% CI: 1.56\u22121.75, similar to previous years. A similar relationship was observed for GAD-7 though the absolute burden of symptoms lower. Conclusion: After accounting for pre-COVID-19 trends, we show that experiencing loneliness and decreased physical activity are risk factors for worsening mental health during the pandemic. Our findings highlight the need to examine policies which target these potentially modifiable risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Background: There is currently major concern about the impact of the global COVID-19 outbreak on mental health. A number of studies suggest that mental health deteriorated in many countries prior to enforced isolation (lockdown), but it remains unknown how mental health has changed during lockdown. Aims: This study explored trajectories of anxiety and depression over the first two months of lockdown using data from the UK, and compared the experiences of individuals with and without diagnosed mental illness. Methods: Data from 53,328 adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a well-stratified panel study weighted to population proportions collecting data weekly during the Covid-19 pandemic) were analysed from 21/03/2020-10/05/2020. Growth curve modelling was fitted accounting for socio-demographic and health covariates. Results: 24.4% of the sample had scores indicating moderate-severe anxiety, and 31.4% indicating moderate-severe depressive symptoms. Over the first two months of lockdown, there was only a slight decrease in anxiety levels amongst participants as a whole and a very small decrease in depression levels between weeks 3-6 that then increased again in weeks 7-8. Adults with pre-existing diagnoses of mental health conditions had higher levels of anxiety and depression but there was no evidence of widening inequalities in mental health experiences compared to people without existing mental illness. Conclusions: Results suggest there has been little improvement in depression and only slight improvements in anxiety since lockdown commenced in the UK. These findings suggest greater efforts need to be made to help individuals manage their mental health during the pandemic.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the longitudinal associations between self-reported physical activity and anxiety and depression symptom severity in adults with long-term physical disabilities.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA secondary analysis of data from a United States-based longitudinal survey study of community-dwelling adults with 1 of 4 potential long-term physical disabilities (multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injury, postpoliomyelitis syndrome). The first time point (T1) for the current study was completed by 1,594 participants. The second survey (T2) was sent 1 year later, and the third (T3) was sent 3 years later; each were completed by 1,380 and 1,218 participants, respectively. At each time point, participants completed a measure of physical activity (Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement System short forms evaluating depression and anxiety severity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMixed growth curve models showed greater quantities of physical activity were associated with decreases in both depression (\u03c72(2) = 84.01, p < .001) and anxiety (\u03c72(2) = 21.66, p < .001) symptom severity over the 4-year period. However, while greater quantities of moderate (anxiety z = -2.24, p < .05; depression z = -5.48, p < .001) and strenuous (anxiety z = -2.59, p < .05; depression z = -3.90, p < .001) physical activity were significantly associated with decreases in negative affect, mild physical activity was not.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe current study provides evidence that physical activity is longitudinally associated with anxious and depressive symptoms in adults with long-term physical disabilities. Future research should examine the quantities and intensities of physical activity necessary to impart psychological benefits. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and related mitigation measures are associated with poorer mental health in cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys. However, it\u2019s unclear if this represents an adaptive response to an unprecedented event that is short lived, or the beginning of longer mental health problems that persist beyond the initial outbreak of the pandemic. We used data from the index generation of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (young people aged 26-29) to examine anxiety at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020) and again once restrictions were eased (June 2020). We compared these to two pre-pandemic assessments of anxiety measured 2013/2014 and 2015/17. We found that the percentage of individuals with anxiety was almost double during the COVID-19 assessments compared to pre-pandemic levels, with 15% of individuals having anxiety at both occasions (persistent anxiety). Being female, those with per-existing mental health conditions, a history of financial problems and those who had reported difficulties accessing mental health information were at greater risk of persistent anxiety. Our findings suggest that anxiety in response to COVID-19 is not just an initial reaction but potentially the start of a persistent problem that extends beyond the pandemic. Efforts must be made to address risk groups who could be disproportionally affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation measures.",
