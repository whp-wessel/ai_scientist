  "abstract": "This study examined social and individual predictors of internalizing symptoms in college students, and in particular explored the indirect effects of mother and father support through self-esteem. A total of 123 college students completed self-reported online surveys measuring mother and father support, self-esteem, and internalizing symptoms (depression and anxiety, withdrawal, and somatic symptoms). Students reported greater support from mothers compared to fathers, t (114) = 5.84, p < .001. On average, higher maternal (but not paternal) support (\u03b2 = -0.25, p = .006) and self-esteem (\u03b2 = -0.61, p < .001) were associated with lower internalizing symptoms. For women, self-esteem mediated the relationship between maternal support and internalizing symptoms, indicating that greater maternal support was associated with greater self-esteem, which in turn was associated with lower internalizing symptoms (F = 41.98, p < .001). However, this pathway was not significant for men. These results highlight the importance of exploring the influence of different sources of support separately, and suggest that improving self-esteem for both men and women, and improving maternal support for women may decrease risk for internalizing symptoms in emerging adulthood. https://doi.org/10.24839/2325-7342.JN22.2.131",
