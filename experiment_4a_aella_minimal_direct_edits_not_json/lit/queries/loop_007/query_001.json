      "abstract": "Abstract Previous researches suggest that individuals with different attachment styles practice different styles of love, but these do not consider the role of trust, communication, and closeness to the father and mother separately. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship and the impact of parental attachment, through the analysis of the participants\u2019 self-reported account and romantic styles in Italians emerging adulthood by using a multidimensional approach (trust, communication, closeness to father and mother). The 296 participants (19\u201329 years; 50.7% males) rated items of information on a questionnaire, regarding their perspective of their attachment to their mother/father and attitude toward love. Using a variable-centred approach and a person-centred approach, the results suggest that the respondents differed in levels of parental attachment or love styles and that the present parental attachment has a positive impact on their romantic relationship. It is possible to estimate romantic relationships and prevent manic relationships based on the individual\u2019s current perceptions of their attachment to the father or mother. The role of parents and paternal attachment, are still fundamental in Italian young adults. The role of communication with the mother, in particular, is controversial and should be further investigated.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThe aim of this research was to determine differentiation in respect of self-esteem and perfectionism in the groups of women selected based on the criterion of the quality of retrospective assessment of parental attitudes of fathers. I also searched for predictive value of retrospectively perceived parental attitudes of fathers for the perfectionism and self-esteem of women in early adulthood as well as correlations between self-esteem and types of perfectionism.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe research included 87 women in early adulthood (M = 21.64; SD = 4.84), from the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Province. The following research tools were used: Questionnaire of Retrospective Assessment of Parental Attitudes, Adaptive and Maladaptive Perfectionism Questionnaire, Multidimensional Self-esteem Inventory.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe obtained research results indicate the occurrence of differentiation with regard to self-esteem and perfectionism of women in terms of the quality of retrospective assessment of parental attitudes of fathers. The women who assessed the parental attitudes of their fathers negatively obtained higher mean scores in maladaptive perfectionism and lower ones in general self-esteem and its dimensions (i.e., being loved, self-control, defensive strengthening of selfesteem, self-acceptance, popularity, identity integration) than the women who described the parental attitudes of their fathers as positive. It was found out that retrospective assessment of parental attitudes of fathers, both in the positive and negative aspects, had predictive value in the direction consistent with the expectations for maladaptive perfectionism as well as general self-esteem and its dimensions. It was shown that there were significant correlations between types of perfectionism and general self-esteem.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe fact of indicating the role of retrospective assessment of parental attitudes of fathers in the context of building of self-esteem and perfectionism demonstrated by young women contributes to updating the psychological knowledge in this respect as well as plays a significant part in psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Parental alienation is a growing concern today. Many children grow up without the care and love of their parents. As a result, there are feelings of emotional rejection felt by the children, and some lead to a life of delinquency. This research aims to discover the effects of parental alienation and coping mechanisms of alienated children toward a better life. It utilized a qualitative research method through a phenomenological approach through an interview of four alienated children. The study reveals that the participants who have experienced parental alienation suffer from internal and external behavioral problems and search for their identity after reaching adulthood, which also leads to devastating complex trauma and low self-esteem. With this, parental alienation calls for a child protection response since it can be a form of collective abuse and the custodial parents may safeguard the child\u2019s relationship with an alienated parent to avoid negative views through counseling or focused group discussion, the Department of Social welfare and Development (DSWD) and Children Protection Desk (WCPD) can implement a Family Bridge Program an educational and experiential workshop that helps unreasonably alienated children and adolescents adjust to living with a parent they claim to hate or fear",
