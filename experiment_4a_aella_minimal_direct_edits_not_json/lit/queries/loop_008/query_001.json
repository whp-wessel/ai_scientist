      "abstract": "Abstract The study aims to investigate the associations of compassion and self-compassion with body composition, and whether adulthood compassion and self-compassion moderate the relationship between childhood SEP and adulthood body composition. The participants came from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 Study (n\u2009=\u2009789, 52.1% women), with a mean age of 34.0\u2009years. Compassion and self-compassion were measured with the Dispositional Positive Emotions Scale and Self-Compassion Scale\u2013Short Form, respectively. Body composition was assessed using anthropometric and body fat measurements at a clinic. Childhood SEP included parental occupation, education, and employment. The results showed that high compassion was associated with three out of the five body composition measurements, namely lower waist circumference (B\u2009=\u2009\u22120.960, p\u2009=\u20090.039, 95% CI: \u22121.870; \u22120.498), body fat percentage (B\u2009=\u2009\u22120.693, p\u2009=\u20090.030, 95% CI: \u22121.317; \u22120.069), and fat mass index (B\u2009=\u2009\u22120.325, p\u2009=\u20090.023, 95% CI: \u22120.605; \u22120.044) (adjusted for sex, and childhood and adulthood SEP) but not with body mass index or waist-to-hip ratio. Self-compassion was not associated with body composition. Neither compassion nor self-compassion moderated the association between childhood SEP and adulthood body composition, as the interaction effects were not significant. Therefore, the dispositions did not protect against the negative effects of childhood SEP on adulthood body composition. High other-directed compassion may be, however, associated with healthier body composition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Previous researches suggest that individuals with different attachment styles practice different styles of love, but these do not consider the role of trust, communication, and closeness to the father and mother separately. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship and the impact of parental attachment, through the analysis of the participants\u2019 self-reported account and romantic styles in Italians emerging adulthood by using a multidimensional approach (trust, communication, closeness to father and mother). The 296 participants (19\u201329 years; 50.7% males) rated items of information on a questionnaire, regarding their perspective of their attachment to their mother/father and attitude toward love. Using a variable-centred approach and a person-centred approach, the results suggest that the respondents differed in levels of parental attachment or love styles and that the present parental attachment has a positive impact on their romantic relationship. It is possible to estimate romantic relationships and prevent manic relationships based on the individual\u2019s current perceptions of their attachment to the father or mother. The role of parents and paternal attachment, are still fundamental in Italian young adults. The role of communication with the mother, in particular, is controversial and should be further investigated.",

      "abstract": "Emerging adulthood who having a parental support for autonomy and reduced control exerted will show a high self-esteem. In addition, this is also related to his success in academic. Because emerging adulthood is related to college student age. So it is important to be able to measure the parental autonomy support and controlling parents obtained by students in Indonesia. This measurement tool for perceived parental autonomy was developed by Mageau in 2015 and has never been adapted in Indonesia. This study aims to evaluate the validity and reliability of the perceived parental autonomy support measuring instrument in Indonesian. Content validity for this measure uses CVI. Then use CTT to analyze reliability and discrimination items. Participants in this study were 272 students who were collected using accidental sampling technique. The results of the adapted measuring instrument are relevant for measuring the construct, by liberating the three items on the controlling parent dimension, the CVI valuesfor each dimension are 1 and .98, while the reliable values are .93 and .87. In the CFA results, the fit model can be accepted on every dimension.Emerging adulthood yang mendapatkan dukungan otonomi orang tua dan pengurangan kontrol yang diberikan akan menunjukkan self-esteem yang tinggi dan juga berkaitan dengan keberhasilannya di akademik. Dikarenakan usia emerging adulthood berada pada 18-24 tahun yang sebagian besar berprofesi sebagai mahamahasiswa. Maka dari itu, penting untuk dapat mengukur parental autonomy support dan controlling parent yang didapatkan oleh mahasiswa. Alat ukur perceived parental autonomy support ini dikembangkan oleh Mageau tahun 2015 dan belum pernah diadaptasi di Indonesia. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengevaluasi validitas dan reliabilitas alat ukur perceived parental autonomy support dalam bahasa Indonesia. Validitas konten untuk alat ukur ini menggunakan CVI. Kemudian menggunakan CTT untuk menganalisis reliabilitas dan diskriminasi aitem. Partisipan pada penelitian ini yaitu mahamahasiswa sebanyak 272 yang dikumpulkan menggunakan teknik sampling insidental. Hasil alat ukur yang diadaptasi relevan untuk mengukur konstruk, dengan membebaskan tiga item pada dimensi controlling parent didapatkan nilai CVI untuk setiap dimensi yaitu 1 dan .98, sedangkan untuk nilai reliabel yaitu .93 dan .87. Pada hasil CFA, model fit dapat diterima pada setiap dimensi.",
