      "abstract": "The current study examined whether delivering wellbeing interventions in schools impacted anxiety development in middle childhood. Schools have an important role to play in addressing children\u2019s anxiety through daily practice in classrooms and by implementing specialist wellbeing interventions that support children\u2019s coping. A nationally representative sample of Irish primary school children (N = 2313; 48.9% male) were surveyed when they were in second class (M age 8.09 years, SD = 0.39) and fourth class (M age 9.96 years, SD = 0.40) of primary school. Teachers reported on wellbeing interventions in schools. Key findings from moderation analyses suggest that family affluence and being female predicted a greater increase in anxiety development and that wellbeing interventions interacted with family affluence to reduce anxiety development for more affluent children. These findings can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of wellbeing interventions for a more efficacious approach to minimising children\u2019s anxiety development.",

      "abstract": "Pakistan, as an environmentally vulnerable country, has experienced many natural catastrophes over the last two decades, resulting in significant human, socioeconomic, infrastructural, and agricultural losses. These events have had diverse impacts on people based on class, gender, geography, and cultural diversity leading to varied perceptions influenced by their intersectionality. This study explores the prevailing cultural-religious interpretations regarding the causes of disasters within the local community of Upper Dir, one of the main vulnerable districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. Qualitative research methods were used to conduct interviews with the local community, ensuring gender balance among respondents to capture their diverse views. The study\u2019s major findings reveal that causes of disasters are interpreted through religious and cultural narratives, attributing deviation from these normative structures as responsible for their occurrence. Notably, these narratives are gendered as women\u2019s actions and their departure from traditional feminine traits and roles are considered the primary reasons for \u2018divine retribution\u2019 manifesting as disasters. In communities strongly shaped by cultural and religious beliefs, enhancing public awareness is critical for ensuring that disaster preparedness strategies resonate with local values and practices, ultimately helping to reduce the adverse impacts of disasters.\nJEL Classification Codes: Q54",

      "abstract": "It is observed that classification of generation, which is frequently applied to analyse a wide range of fields from political analysis to daily life practices, has been situated on a quite problematic ground. Generation issue has either been dealt with the previous generation, more frequently the new generation, or has been discussed at the crossroad of future conception of political or ideological areas. In this study, we aim to analyse the socio-cultural background of generation perception and the differences based on its intellectual conception. We especially intend to scrutinize the reality of current discourses such as a bad generation is emerging, generations are getting alienated to religion, culture and values, and to analyse the perception of generation, a conception upon which these discourses built. \nGeneration perception fed by the tensions produced by socio-cultural differentiation and the anxiety of the next generation resulting from this tensions as a background analyses have been used as a basis both for the expectations of the previous generations from the next generations and the domination they want to establish on them, and for the state policies carried out over the generations. Societies try to shape their future through the strategies they develop over generations. At this point, generational politics and generation perception may include political expectations together with the actual problems arising from a particular period. While future visions produced by the state are understandable and legitimate to a certain extent, the fact that the same monopoly could be observed in the organization of non-governmental organizations and groups shows the problematic dimensions of the concept of generational perception. Relatively utopian and anachronistic discourses in the history of Turkey such as long-awaited generation, Ataturkist youth, B\u00fcy\u00fck Do\u011fu (Great East) youth, ideal youth construct the foundations of legitimacy through socio-political processes in addition to instrumentalizing social anxiety to produce ideological discourses. \nThe sample of the study, which deals with the perception of generation more problematically on the basis of anxiety and expectation, consists of X and Y religious middle-class residents of Antalya province based on economic and lifestyle. The middle-class concept is grounded on the classical stratification and lifestyle-based epistemological approach to status groups. In the context of the religious middle class, the adjective \"religious\" was based on the self-declarations of the participants and this usage was preferred due to the central positioning of religion in their daily lives. Having the same cultural capital or lifestyle is actually a factor that narrows the generational differentiation. However, the fact that it is the same group that most objects to generational differentiation can be interpreted as the reason for our conceptualization of generational perception. In the texts written on generation, the following categories are included in general terms: The Silent Generation (before 1946), Baby Boomer Generation (1946-64), Generation X (1965-1979), Generation Y (1980-2000), Gen Z (after 2001). Specific to this study, from field data the categories are as follows: Religious Middle Class Generation X (1965-1980). Transition Period Generation X-Y (1976-1985) and The Last Generation Y (1986-2000). \nThe core of the study, which is based upon qualitative paradigm, is generated by qualitative data techniques, in-depth interview and focus group discussions. The in-depth interview technique based on the semi-structured interview form have been used in the research and the participants have been selected with snowball or chain reference sampling. In this context, in-depth interviews were conducted with 34 people and a focus group study was conducted with 19 people, which means totally 53 participants, who belong to different ages and occupational groups, and define themselves or their family as religious/conservative, have been included in this study as the sample of the study. Upon repetition of the responds, it is thought that the data has reached at the saturating point so data collecting process is ended up. As a result of the data obtained from the field, it seems that it is more important in understanding the issue of the conceptualization of generation perception and its resolution through differentiation rather than conflict. In the study, since it contains current and problematic references, the concept generation is preferred. It has been observed that the Religious Middle Class Generation X gives a lot of space to concepts such as awareness, consciousness and ideal in the analysis of generations, based on the projections of the periods they lived in. It can be stated that the religious generation X-Y of the transition period brought the concern of understanding the generations more to the fore.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To assess the use of SRQ-20 and RCOPE as complementary tools to the Nursing Process. \nMethods: This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study carried out with 313 adults from two therapeutic communities (Therapeutic communities are usually residential facilities in which the community structure and function are agents of change. Community members progress through varying roles and responsibilities in their recovery and collectively ensure day-to-day functioning of the community.). \u00a0and a community mental health treatment unit, located in two cities in northern Paran\u00e1 (Brazil). \nResults: The sample consisted of 313 individuals, aged between 18 and 68 years (M = 36.87, SD = 13.21). The majority of participants (57.9%) were female, of east-asian descent (35.7%), with a socioeconomic level equivalent to US$252.48 (65.8%) and incomplete secondary education (60%). Of the sample, 43.4% (n = 136) had a depressive disorder and 23.7% (n = 74) had an anxiety disorder. As for suicidal behavior, 52.1% of the participants mentioned having suicidal ideation at some point in their lives. Of those with ideation (n = 163), more than half (54.6%) reported not seeking help in times of crisis. Based on the frequencies obtained using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), 41.9% of the subjects obtained a score of 8 points, representing the cut-off point for risk of mental disorders. Regarding the hours of religious practices carried out by the participant (measured in weekly hours), the average obtained was 2.70 hours. \nConclusions: The application of the SRQ-20 helped identify that 48.58% of the individuals were classified as suffering from psychological distress. The early identification of signs of suffering and religious coping strategies have proven to be beneficial and necessary for the nurse's work process, as it adds better direction to the anamnesis and also to the alignment of the health team in promoting comprehensive care, including aspects of the spiritual dimension in nursing care.\u00a0",

      "abstract": "Abstract Risks for cognitive impairment are disproportionately high among Black men, however religious practices and beliefs have been shown to be protective for members of this group with modest incomes, suggesting that social class can complicate this association. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between religious practices and/or beliefs, socioeconomic status (SES), and cognitive status among Black men in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Data were drawn from 384 Black men who completed the Core and Leave Behind Questionnaires. The primary outcome was any cognitive impairment, a dichotomous variable derived from a modified version of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS). Religious practices and beliefs (private prayer, religious beliefs) and SES (income, education) were primary independent variables. Descriptive results indicate that individuals reporting incomes less than $50,000 had a higher proportion of any cognitive impairment than respondents reporting higher incomes (48.2% vs 19.1%). Differences in any cognitive impairment were also found between respondents reporting 12 or fewer years of education and individuals reporting more than twelve years of education (48.8% vs 19.8%). Data from modified Poisson regression models indicated that personal private prayer (PR=0.67, CI:0.47-0.97) and religious beliefs (PR=0.92, CI:0.84-1.00) were beneficial for Black men with modest incomes. Private prayer was inversely related to any cognitive impairment among Black men with more than 12 years of education (PR=0.51, CI:0.27-0.99). Full-scale studies of Black men are needed to further examine how SES can influence factors that may be protective against cognitive impairment among this population.",
