### Expansion Plan
1. Supplement H2 coverage with longitudinal or interventional parental-guidance studies that include self-love/self-esteem outcomes beyond cross-sectional attachment work.
2. Add at least one longitudinal wealth-mobility study with explicit childhood class conditioning to strengthen H3 (e.g., PSID-based ordered logit work).
3. Deepen religiosity → anxiety coverage with contemporary (post-2018) datasets to support H4 once models are in place.
