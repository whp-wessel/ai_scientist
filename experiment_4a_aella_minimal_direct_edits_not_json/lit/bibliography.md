### Expansion Plan
1. Gather literature on parental guidance/social support and adult self-regard (target next Semantic Scholar paper pulls).
2. Document longitudinal links between childhood class mobility and adult wealth accumulation.
3. Deepen religiosity/anxiety coverage with modern datasets (post-2015) once rate-limit constraints ease.
