# Working Manuscript — Status: PAP Frozen (H1 Confirmatory)

## Title
**Childhood Socio-Emotional Contexts and Adult Wellbeing in the Global Flourishing Study**

## Abstract (placeholder)
We investigate how childhood socio-emotional environments (parental abuse, guidance, class position, religiosity) relate to adult mental health, self-regard, and wealth outcomes using the public balanced sample (`childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv`). During Loop 006 we froze the pre-analysis plan (git tag `pap_freeze_loop006`) and executed the first confirmatory family: two moderation contrasts linking childhood emotional abuse to adult depression through parental guidance buffering and male vulnerability. Both contrasts remain significant after Benjamini–Hochberg control at q=0.05, yielding positive guidance buffering (β=0.068, q=4.6e-16) and negative male vulnerability slopes (β=-0.103, q=5.8e-11). Remaining hypotheses (H2–H4) continue as exploratory until additional literature and diagnostics warrant promotion.

## 1. Introduction
Childhood adversity remains a consistent predictor of adult depression and anxiety across global samples (e.g., Zhang et al., 2025). Supportive parenting and guidance buffer internalizing symptoms by reinforcing self-esteem trajectories (Moore & Shell, 2017) and may moderate the effect of adverse childhood experiences (Zhao et al., 2022). Sex/gender differences also matter: longitudinal Global Flourishing Study evidence shows that early abuse disproportionately elevates depression among men (Assari et al., 2025). Socioeconomic origins shape adult wealth accumulation through persistent class-linked advantages and intergenerational transfers (Hansen, 2014). The present project leverages the balanced Global Flourishing Study (GFS) sample to jointly study these pathways, focusing on: (H1) emotional abuse → adult depression with guidance/gender moderators, (H2) parental guidance → adult self-love, (H3) childhood class → adult net worth, and (H4) religiosity → anxiety.

## 2. Data & Methods
- **Data**: `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` (14,443 × 718). No survey weights/strata were provided after header scans, so we maintain an SRS assumption (see frozen PAP at `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`).
- **Measurement**: Loop 002 extended the priority codebook to cover teen-period exposures plus adjustment covariates, with public tables under `tables/loop002_teen_covariate_numeric.csv` and `tables/loop002_teen_covariate_categorical.csv`. Loop 003 added `scripts/likert_utils.py` + `scripts/loop003_scale_audit.py`, confirming that the survey encodes *Strongly Agree = -3* for all seven-point items; all H1–H4 Likerts are now sign-flipped and z-scored before modeling (diagnostics in `tables/loop003_likert_alignment.csv`) per Sumin (2022).
- **Self-love quality check**: Loop 008 quantified the H2 outcome before PAP promotion. The two-item composite combining the self-love item and the inverted “at war with yourself” item delivers Cronbach’s α = 0.42 (r = 0.27 between items); self-love co-moves with depression/anxiety (r = 0.48 / 0.37) and still correlates with childhood guidance (r = 0.23), so we’ll treat the construct as usable but note the overlap with distress (`tables/loop008_h2_measurement.csv`).
- **Confirmatory scope**: During Loop 006 we froze the PAP (status recorded with git tag `pap_freeze_loop006`) and restricted confirmatory testing to the H1 moderation contrasts: (a) abuse × guidance buffering, (b) abuse × male vulnerability. H2–H4 remain exploratory until they meet the promotion bar laid out in the PAP.
- **Modeling**: Confirmatory H1 models follow `depression_z ~ abuse_child_z + abuse_teen_z + classteen + selfage + gendermale + education + interaction`, executed via `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop004_h1_diagnostics.py`. `scripts/loop005_h1_simple_slopes.py` transforms the interaction coefficients into slopes at ±1 SD guidance and by gender for interpretation. `scripts/run_loop004_models.py` maintains the broader exploratory pipeline (H2–H4) with matching controls and interaction terms. All artifacts are regenerable from the tag referenced above.
- **Multiplicity**: Benjamini–Hochberg at q=0.05 across the two H1 contrasts; exploratory families report raw p-values only.
- **Privacy & reproducibility**: Public tables (e.g., `tables/loop006_h1_confirmatory.csv`) disclose only aggregate statistics with minimum cell counts ≥135, satisfying the n<10 suppression rule. Commands, seeds, and outputs are logged in `analysis/decision_log.csv` and `notebooks/research_notebook.md`.
- **H3 net-worth specification**: Loop 010 relaxed the proportional-odds assumption by allowing the childhood class slopes to vary by wealth cutpoint via a partial proportional-odds (PPO) stacked logit (`scripts/loop010_h3_partial_models.py`, tables/loop010_h3_threshold_effects.csv). Loop 011 benchmarked this PPO estimator against a multinomial logit with identical predictors (`scripts/loop011_h3_multinomial_benchmark.py`). The multinomial fit improves per-person log-likelihood (−1.72 vs. −2.94) but requires 54 slope parameters and yields near-zero marginal effects of childhood class on the top wealth bin (`tables/loop011_h3_multinomial_marginals.csv`). Because the PPO model respects the ordered scale while isolating where proportional odds fail, it remains the manuscript’s preferred H3 specification and aligns with evidence that multi-generational class stickiness constrains upward mobility (Chan & Boliver, 2013) while wealth-based disparities exceed other SES gaps (Glei et al., 2022). Loop 022 filed eight LOI templates plus the high-wealth RFP/replicate manifest, and by Loop 024 two partners (UAE, Singapore) have countersigned while the remaining six are in legal review; `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv` and `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/qna_loop021.md` now log each status change and vendor clarification so reviewers can audit the path toward a better-powered ≥$10M estimand.
- **H3 pooled-wave feasibility**: Loop 018 prototypes ( `tables/loop018_h3_wavepooling_summary.csv`) show that even optimistic expansions—pooling two or three identical GFS waves or doubling the ≥$10M tier—keep the cluster-adjusted power below 0.30 because the 24-country design effect (~14.8×) dominates the analytic SE gains. We therefore keep the ≥$10M PPO slope exploratory until new respondents or countries boost the effective n beyond the confirmatory threshold.
- **H4 alternative anxiety codings**: Loop 012 collapsed the anxiety items into a 3-bin ordinal outcome plus a ≥5 “high anxiety” flag, and Loop 013 summarized the religiosity coefficients across all codings (`tables/loop013_h4_outcome_effects.csv`, `figures/loop013_h4_outcome_effects.png`). Every specification uses the same covariates (classchild, classteen, age, gender, education), giving the sensitivity section a single visual to cite.
- **H4 promotion memo**: Loop 019 formalized the `religiosity_class_gradients` candidate family in `docs/religiosity_class_gradients_promotion.md`, documenting the moderate and serious practice × classchild interactions, the confirmatory regeneration commands, and the Benjamini–Hochberg plan (m = 2, q_moderate = 0.023, q_serious = 0.194) required for the next PAP freeze.

## 3. Confirmatory Findings (H1 family)
- **Guidance buffering (H1a)**: Table `tables/loop006_h1_confirmatory.csv` reports β = 0.0678 (SE = 0.0083, 95% CI [0.052, 0.084], p = 2.3e-16, q = 4.6e-16). The positive interaction indicates that each SD increase in childhood guidance attenuates the abuse→depression slope by 0.068 SD, aligning with buffering evidence from Zhao et al. (2022). Simple slopes (`tables/loop005_h1_simple_slopes.csv`) confirm that respondents at -1 SD guidance experience a -0.13 SD abuse slope versus ≈0 slope at +1 SD guidance.
- **Male vulnerability (H1b)**: β = -0.103 (SE = 0.0157, 95% CI [-0.133, -0.072], p = 5.8e-11, q = 5.8e-11). Abuse predicts worse depression among men even after accounting for teen abuse and controls, paralleling sex-differentiated ACE effects documented by Assari et al. (2025). Simple slopes show a -0.13 SD effect for men versus -0.02 SD for women.
- Both contrasts survive BH at q=0.05 and retain the preregistered sign expectations. These estimates feed `analysis/results.csv` under `result_id` `loop006_h1_*_confirm` with `confirmatory=TRUE` and document the commands/seed used for reproducibility.
- **Visualization**: Figure `figures/loop009_h1_confirmatory_interactions.png` overlays the preregistered models’ predicted depression_z trajectories across the abuse distribution. The left panel shows guidance buffering (lines at ±1 SD and the mean), and the right panel shows the male-vulnerability slope split by gender. Underlying point estimates plus 95% CIs live in `tables/loop009_h1_interaction_grid.csv` with each grid cell referencing ≥14k respondents, satisfying the n≥10 disclosure rule.
- **Robustness checks**: Loop 007 reran the confirmatory models with HC3 SEs and, separately, an expanded covariate set that adds childhood/current class, religious intensity, and teen guidance (`tables/loop007_h1_sensitivity.csv`; narrative in `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md`). Interaction signs/magnitudes are stable (guidance buffering ≈0.064–0.068; male vulnerability ≈-0.095 to -0.103) and remain significant after BH correction, reinforcing the confirmatory conclusions.
- **Bootstrap sensitivity**: Loop 012 implemented a 500-replicate respondent bootstrap (`scripts/loop012_h1_bootstrap.py`). Percentile intervals in `tables/loop012_h1_bootstrap_summary.csv` show guidance buffering centered at 0.068 (95% CI [0.052, 0.084]) and male vulnerability at -0.102 (95% CI [-0.129, -0.074]), with zero never appearing in the draws. Guidance simple-slope distributions (`tables/loop012_h1_bootstrap_slopes_summary.csv`) reaffirm that abuse strongly predicts depression at low parental guidance while flattening near +1 SD guidance.

## 4. Exploratory Findings (H3–H4)
- **H3 (childhood class → net worth)**: PPO threshold effects in `tables/loop012_h3_classchild_effects.csv` show that childhood class strongly predicts escaping deep debt (log-odds ≈0.13–0.14 for ≥$-10k through ≥$0) and re-emerges for the ≥$10M tier (0.11, p=0.002), whereas the ≥$100k and ≥$1MM cutpoints shrink toward zero. Loop 014’s country-cluster bootstrap (`scripts/loop014_h3_cluster_bootstrap.py --n-reps 300`) initially targeted the ≥$100k/≥$1MM contrasts, and Loop 015 added ≥$10M to the draw summary (`tables/loop014_h3_bootstrap_summary.csv`). The ≥$100k and ≥$1MM slopes center at 0.006 and 0.009 with wide percentile intervals ([-0.149, 0.123] and [-0.129, 0.218]), but ≥$10M averages 0.134 (SD 0.140, CI [-0.084, 0.486], tail probability 0.21), matching the large-sample PPO estimate and justifying a pivot to that cutpoint for the confirmatory plan. Loop 016 quantified the finite-sample limits: only 820 respondents enter the ≥$10M bin, the cluster-adjusted SE inflates to 0.140 log-odds, and the implied design effect is 14.8 (effective n≈978). Table `tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv` and the reviewer-ready shell `tables/loop016_h3_confirmatory.csv` document these metrics so the PAP can transparently state that the confirmatory family will contain a single, low-power contrast unless the sample grows. Loop 022 adds tangible mitigation evidence by filing the eight LOI templates (two countersigned as of Loop 024), the independent high-wealth RFP (`docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/rfp_2025-11-09.md`), and the replicate-weight manifest (`docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md`); the PAP-freeze workplan in `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md` now links those artifacts to the eventual `childhood_class_networth_ge10m` promotion.
- **H4 (religiosity → anxiety)**: Religiosity remains protective across outcomes, and new interaction diagnostics clarify where the effect is strongest. Table `tables/loop013_h4_outcome_effects.csv` plus Figure `figures/loop013_h4_outcome_effects.png` document consistent main effects (−0.062 SD, −0.11 log-odds, −2.5 p.p.). Loop 014 added the initial class/gender interaction table `tables/loop014_h4_interactions.csv`, and Loop 015 introduced richer controls (adds `classcurrent` and religiosity dummies). Loop 020 re-estimated the classchild interactions via `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop020_h4_stress_tests.py`, producing `tables/loop020_h4_stress_test_coeffs.csv` alongside binary/ordinal probability deltas and a ridge (α=5) shrinkage check. The binary ≥5 outcome still yields −0.130 (p=0.012, q=0.023) for the moderate-practice × classchild slope, while the serious-practice interaction remains negative (−0.086, p=0.194, q=0.194) but becomes significant under both ridge (β=-0.122, p=0.047) and the 3-bin ordinal coding (β=-0.128, p=0.031). Public grid `tables/loop015_h4_predicted_grid.csv`, Figure `figures/loop015_h4_classinteraction.png`, and the refreshed four-row confirmatory template `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv` (moderate/serious × binary/ordinal) will travel together during the next PAP freeze so reviewers can audit both anxiety codings before promotion; probability deltas for every coding live in `tables/loop020_h4_highflag_prob_deltas.csv` and `tables/loop020_h4_ord3_prob_deltas.csv`.

## 5. Next Steps
1. Finalize the DG-4827 replicate-weight delivery: Data Governance still owes the PSU IDs, base weights, and BRR/Fay matrices (see `tables/loop021_h3_weight_delivery_status.csv`); once the encrypted drop lands, rerun `scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py` followed by `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py --use-weights` so the design-effect refresh flows into `tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv` and the PAP.
2. Execute the `religiosity_class_gradients` freeze once reviewers sign off: rerun `scripts/loop020_h4_stress_tests.py`, refresh `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv`, mark the family confirmatory in `analysis/hypotheses.csv`/`analysis/results.csv`, and tag the new PAP state (`pap_freeze_h4_loop024` placeholder).
3. Maintain the design-effect evidence trail by logging vendor Q&A for the high-wealth RFP, updating the LOI register (`docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv`) as partners move from intent to contract, and capturing every change in `analysis/decision_log.csv` plus `notebooks/research_notebook.md`.
