## Title
**Childhood Socio-Emotional Contexts and Adult Wellbeing in the Global Flourishing Study**

## Abstract (placeholder)
We investigate how childhood socio-emotional environments (parental abuse, guidance, class position, religiosity) relate to adult mental health, self-regard, and wealth outcomes using the public balanced sample (`childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv`). During Loop 006 we froze the pre-analysis plan (git tag `pap_freeze_loop006`) and executed the first confirmatory family: two moderation contrasts linking childhood emotional abuse to adult depression through parental guidance buffering and male vulnerability. Both contrasts remain significant after Benjamini–Hochberg control at q=0.05, yielding positive guidance buffering (β=0.068, q=4.6e-16) and negative male vulnerability slopes (β=-0.103, q=5.8e-11). Remaining hypotheses (H2–H4) continue as exploratory until additional literature and diagnostics warrant promotion.

## 1. Introduction
Childhood adversity remains a consistent predictor of adult depression and anxiety across global samples (e.g., Zhang et al., 2025). Supportive parenting and guidance buffer internalizing symptoms by reinforcing self-esteem trajectories (Moore & Shell, 2017) and may moderate the effect of adverse childhood experiences (Zhao et al., 2022). Sex/gender differences also matter: longitudinal Global Flourishing Study evidence shows that early abuse disproportionately elevates depression among men (Assari et al., 2025). Socioeconomic origins shape adult wealth accumulation through persistent class-linked advantages and intergenerational transfers (Hansen, 2014). The present project leverages the balanced Global Flourishing Study (GFS) sample to jointly study these pathways, focusing on: (H1) emotional abuse → adult depression with guidance/gender moderators, (H2) parental guidance → adult self-love, (H3) childhood class → adult net worth, and (H4) religiosity → anxiety.

## 2. Data & Methods
- **Data**: `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` (14,443 × 718). No survey weights/strata were provided after header scans, so we maintain an SRS assumption (see frozen PAP at `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`).
- **Measurement**: Loop 002 extended the priority codebook to cover teen-period exposures plus adjustment covariates, with public tables under `tables/loop002_teen_covariate_numeric.csv` and `tables/loop002_teen_covariate_categorical.csv`. Loop 003 added `scripts/likert_utils.py` + `scripts/loop003_scale_audit.py`, confirming that the survey encodes *Strongly Agree = -3* for all seven-point items; all H1–H4 Likerts are now sign-flipped and z-scored before modeling (diagnostics in `tables/loop003_likert_alignment.csv`) per Sumin (2022).
- **Confirmatory scope**: During Loop 006 we froze the PAP (status recorded with git tag `pap_freeze_loop006`) and restricted confirmatory testing to the H1 moderation contrasts: (a) abuse × guidance buffering, (b) abuse × male vulnerability. H2–H4 remain exploratory until they meet the promotion bar laid out in the PAP.
- **Modeling**: Confirmatory H1 models follow `depression_z ~ abuse_child_z + abuse_teen_z + classteen + selfage + gendermale + education + interaction`, executed via `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop004_h1_diagnostics.py`. `scripts/loop005_h1_simple_slopes.py` transforms the interaction coefficients into slopes at ±1 SD guidance and by gender for interpretation. `scripts/run_loop004_models.py` maintains the broader exploratory pipeline (H2–H4) with matching controls and interaction terms. All artifacts are regenerable from the tag referenced above.
- **Multiplicity**: Benjamini–Hochberg at q=0.05 across the two H1 contrasts; exploratory families report raw p-values only.
- **Privacy & reproducibility**: Public tables (e.g., `tables/loop006_h1_confirmatory.csv`) disclose only aggregate statistics with minimum cell counts ≥135, satisfying the n<10 suppression rule. Commands, seeds, and outputs are logged in `analysis/decision_log.csv` and `notebooks/research_notebook.md`.

## 3. Confirmatory Findings (H1 family)
- **Guidance buffering (H1a)**: Table `tables/loop006_h1_confirmatory.csv` reports β = 0.0678 (SE = 0.0083, 95% CI [0.052, 0.084], p = 2.3e-16, q = 4.6e-16). The positive interaction indicates that each SD increase in childhood guidance attenuates the abuse→depression slope by 0.068 SD, aligning with buffering evidence from Zhao et al. (2022). Simple slopes (`tables/loop005_h1_simple_slopes.csv`) confirm that respondents at -1 SD guidance experience a -0.13 SD abuse slope versus ≈0 slope at +1 SD guidance.
- **Male vulnerability (H1b)**: β = -0.103 (SE = 0.0157, 95% CI [-0.133, -0.072], p = 5.8e-11, q = 5.8e-11). Abuse predicts worse depression among men even after accounting for teen abuse and controls, paralleling sex-differentiated ACE effects documented by Assari et al. (2025). Simple slopes show a -0.13 SD effect for men versus -0.02 SD for women.
- Both contrasts survive BH at q=0.05 and retain the preregistered sign expectations. These estimates feed `analysis/results.csv` under `result_id` `loop006_h1_*_confirm` with `confirmatory=TRUE` and document the commands/seed used for reproducibility.
- **Robustness checks**: Loop 007 reran the confirmatory models with HC3 SEs and, separately, an expanded covariate set that adds childhood/current class, religious intensity, and teen guidance (`tables/loop007_h1_sensitivity.csv`; narrative in `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md`). Interaction signs/magnitudes are stable (guidance buffering ≈0.064–0.068; male vulnerability ≈-0.095 to -0.103) and remain significant after BH correction, reinforcing the confirmatory conclusions.

## 4. Exploratory Context (H2–H4)
- Measurement updates and exploratory coefficients remain as previously reported: positive childhood guidance → self-love association (β ≈ 0.09 SD, p<1e-11), muted childhood-class effects on adult net worth once teen class is included (β ≈ 0.026, p=0.24), and religiosity × childhood-class interaction negative (β ≈ -0.021, p=0.0046) with null main effect when interactions enter. These findings remain labeled `confirmatory=FALSE` pending literature + diagnostics specified in the PAP.
- Weighted design remains unavailable, so all exploratory disclosures reiterate the SRS justification and restrict public tables to n≥10 cells.

## 5. Next Steps
1. Extend literature review + diagnostics for H2–H4 to determine which estimands, if any, qualify for the next PAP freeze (per `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`).
2. Produce sensitivity checks for the H1 confirmatory family (e.g., alternate covariate sets, heteroskedasticity-robust HC3) and summarize in `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md` before entering the sensitivity phase.
3. Translate confirmatory coefficients into manuscript-ready prose and visualizations (interaction plots) while ensuring tables under `tables/` continue to mask small cells.
