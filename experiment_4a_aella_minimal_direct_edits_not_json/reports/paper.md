## Title
**Childhood Socio-Emotional Contexts and Adult Wellbeing in the Global Flourishing Study**

## Abstract (placeholder)
We investigate how childhood socio-emotional environments (parental abuse, guidance, class position, religiosity) relate to adult mental health, self-regard, and wealth outcomes using the public balanced sample (`childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv`). During Loop 006 we froze the pre-analysis plan (git tag `pap_freeze_loop006`) and executed the first confirmatory family: two moderation contrasts linking childhood emotional abuse to adult depression through parental guidance buffering and male vulnerability. Both contrasts remain significant after Benjamini–Hochberg control at q=0.05, yielding positive guidance buffering (β=0.068, q=4.6e-16) and negative male vulnerability slopes (β=-0.103, q=5.8e-11). Remaining hypotheses (H2–H4) continue as exploratory until additional literature and diagnostics warrant promotion.

## 1. Introduction
Childhood adversity remains a consistent predictor of adult depression and anxiety across global samples (e.g., Zhang et al., 2025). Supportive parenting and guidance buffer internalizing symptoms by reinforcing self-esteem trajectories (Moore & Shell, 2017) and may moderate the effect of adverse childhood experiences (Zhao et al., 2022). Sex/gender differences also matter: longitudinal Global Flourishing Study evidence shows that early abuse disproportionately elevates depression among men (Assari et al., 2025). Socioeconomic origins shape adult wealth accumulation through persistent class-linked advantages and intergenerational transfers (Hansen, 2014). The present project leverages the balanced Global Flourishing Study (GFS) sample to jointly study these pathways, focusing on: (H1) emotional abuse → adult depression with guidance/gender moderators, (H2) parental guidance → adult self-love, (H3) childhood class → adult net worth, and (H4) religiosity → anxiety.

## 2. Data & Methods
- **Data**: `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv` (14,443 × 718). No survey weights/strata were provided after header scans, so we maintain an SRS assumption (see frozen PAP at `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`).
- **Measurement**: Loop 002 extended the priority codebook to cover teen-period exposures plus adjustment covariates, with public tables under `tables/loop002_teen_covariate_numeric.csv` and `tables/loop002_teen_covariate_categorical.csv`. Loop 003 added `scripts/likert_utils.py` + `scripts/loop003_scale_audit.py`, confirming that the survey encodes *Strongly Agree = -3* for all seven-point items; all H1–H4 Likerts are now sign-flipped and z-scored before modeling (diagnostics in `tables/loop003_likert_alignment.csv`) per Sumin (2022).
- **Self-love quality check**: Loop 008 quantified the H2 outcome before PAP promotion. The two-item composite combining the self-love item and the inverted “at war with yourself” item delivers Cronbach’s α = 0.42 (r = 0.27 between items); self-love co-moves with depression/anxiety (r = 0.48 / 0.37) and still correlates with childhood guidance (r = 0.23), so we’ll treat the construct as usable but note the overlap with distress (`tables/loop008_h2_measurement.csv`).
- **Confirmatory scope**: During Loop 006 we froze the PAP (status recorded with git tag `pap_freeze_loop006`) and restricted confirmatory testing to the H1 moderation contrasts: (a) abuse × guidance buffering, (b) abuse × male vulnerability. H2–H4 remain exploratory until they meet the promotion bar laid out in the PAP.
- **Modeling**: Confirmatory H1 models follow `depression_z ~ abuse_child_z + abuse_teen_z + classteen + selfage + gendermale + education + interaction`, executed via `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop004_h1_diagnostics.py`. `scripts/loop005_h1_simple_slopes.py` transforms the interaction coefficients into slopes at ±1 SD guidance and by gender for interpretation. `scripts/run_loop004_models.py` maintains the broader exploratory pipeline (H2–H4) with matching controls and interaction terms. All artifacts are regenerable from the tag referenced above.
- **Multiplicity**: Benjamini–Hochberg at q=0.05 across the two H1 contrasts; exploratory families report raw p-values only.
- **Privacy & reproducibility**: Public tables (e.g., `tables/loop006_h1_confirmatory.csv`) disclose only aggregate statistics with minimum cell counts ≥135, satisfying the n<10 suppression rule. Commands, seeds, and outputs are logged in `analysis/decision_log.csv` and `notebooks/research_notebook.md`.
- **H3 net-worth specification**: Loop 010 relaxed the proportional-odds assumption by allowing the childhood class slopes to vary by wealth cutpoint via a partial proportional-odds (PPO) stacked logit (`scripts/loop010_h3_partial_models.py`, tables/loop010_h3_threshold_effects.csv). Loop 011 benchmarked this PPO estimator against a multinomial logit with identical predictors (`scripts/loop011_h3_multinomial_benchmark.py`). The multinomial fit improves per-person log-likelihood (−1.72 vs. −2.94) but requires 54 slope parameters and yields near-zero marginal effects of childhood class on the top wealth bin (`tables/loop011_h3_multinomial_marginals.csv`). Because the PPO model respects the ordered scale while isolating where proportional odds fail, it remains the manuscript’s preferred H3 specification.

## 3. Confirmatory Findings (H1 family)
- **Guidance buffering (H1a)**: Table `tables/loop006_h1_confirmatory.csv` reports β = 0.0678 (SE = 0.0083, 95% CI [0.052, 0.084], p = 2.3e-16, q = 4.6e-16). The positive interaction indicates that each SD increase in childhood guidance attenuates the abuse→depression slope by 0.068 SD, aligning with buffering evidence from Zhao et al. (2022). Simple slopes (`tables/loop005_h1_simple_slopes.csv`) confirm that respondents at -1 SD guidance experience a -0.13 SD abuse slope versus ≈0 slope at +1 SD guidance.
- **Male vulnerability (H1b)**: β = -0.103 (SE = 0.0157, 95% CI [-0.133, -0.072], p = 5.8e-11, q = 5.8e-11). Abuse predicts worse depression among men even after accounting for teen abuse and controls, paralleling sex-differentiated ACE effects documented by Assari et al. (2025). Simple slopes show a -0.13 SD effect for men versus -0.02 SD for women.
- Both contrasts survive BH at q=0.05 and retain the preregistered sign expectations. These estimates feed `analysis/results.csv` under `result_id` `loop006_h1_*_confirm` with `confirmatory=TRUE` and document the commands/seed used for reproducibility.
- **Visualization**: Figure `figures/loop009_h1_confirmatory_interactions.png` overlays the preregistered models’ predicted depression_z trajectories across the abuse distribution. The left panel shows guidance buffering (lines at ±1 SD and the mean), and the right panel shows the male-vulnerability slope split by gender. Underlying point estimates plus 95% CIs live in `tables/loop009_h1_interaction_grid.csv` with each grid cell referencing ≥14k respondents, satisfying the n≥10 disclosure rule.
- **Robustness checks**: Loop 007 reran the confirmatory models with HC3 SEs and, separately, an expanded covariate set that adds childhood/current class, religious intensity, and teen guidance (`tables/loop007_h1_sensitivity.csv`; narrative in `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md`). Interaction signs/magnitudes are stable (guidance buffering ≈0.064–0.068; male vulnerability ≈-0.095 to -0.103) and remain significant after BH correction, reinforcing the confirmatory conclusions.
- **Bootstrap sensitivity**: Loop 012 implemented a 500-replicate respondent bootstrap (`scripts/loop012_h1_bootstrap.py`). Percentile intervals in `tables/loop012_h1_bootstrap_summary.csv` show guidance buffering centered at 0.068 (95% CI [0.052, 0.084]) and male vulnerability at -0.102 (95% CI [-0.129, -0.074]), with zero never appearing in the draws. Guidance simple-slope distributions (`tables/loop012_h1_bootstrap_slopes_summary.csv`) reaffirm that abuse strongly predicts depression at low parental guidance while flattening near +1 SD guidance.

## 4. Exploratory Context (H2–H4)
- Measurement updates and exploratory coefficients remain as previously reported: positive childhood guidance → self-love association (β ≈ 0.09 SD, p<1e-11), muted childhood-class effects on adult net worth once teen class is included (β ≈ 0.026, p=0.24), and religiosity × childhood-class interaction negative (β ≈ -0.021, p=0.0046) with null main effect when interactions enter. These findings remain labeled `confirmatory=FALSE` pending literature + diagnostics specified in the PAP.
- Loop 008 diagnostics surface two promotion blockers: (a) proportional-odds tests for H3 show the education and gender coefficients vary by ≥0.65 log-odds across cumulative thresholds, suggesting a partial proportional-odds or multinomial alternative before locking in ordered logits (`tables/loop008_h3_po_summary.csv`); (b) modeling religiosity categorically improves the anxiety_z fit relative to a linear ordinal trend (F=6.12, p=0.002), and the “very serious practice” dummy yields -0.41 log-odds for high anxiety (p=3.5e-7) even though the logistic LR test for ordinal vs categorical coding is non-significant at α=0.05 (`tables/loop008_h4_religiosity_models.csv` / `tables/loop008_h4_religiosity_tests.csv`).
- Loop 010 addresses blocker (a) by stacking the nine cumulative logits and fitting a partial proportional-odds model that frees the childhood-class slopes (script `scripts/loop010_h3_partial_models.py`). The resulting threshold effects (`tables/loop010_h3_threshold_effects.csv`) show that childhood class helps respondents escape deep debt (cutpoints -2 to 0, β≈0.13) yet the slope collapses around the ≥$100k bracket (cutpoint 3, β=0.014, p=0.50) before reappearing for the ≥$10M tier (cutpoint 5, β=0.11, p=0.002). Loop 011 benchmarked this PPO estimator against a multinomial logit with identical predictors (`tables/loop011_h3_model_comparison.csv`) and found that classchild marginal effects on the top wealth bin are ≈0.001 (p=0.64; `tables/loop011_h3_multinomial_marginals.csv`), reinforcing the decision to retain the partial proportional-odds framework despite its more complex long-form likelihood.
- Loop 012 tackles blocker (b) by collapsing anxiety into a 3-bin ordinal outcome and a ≥5 “high anxiety” flag (script `scripts/loop012_h4_alt_outcomes.py`). Religiosity slopes remain negative across every specification (`tables/loop012_h4_alt_models.csv`), e.g., β_ord3 = -0.111 (p=2.6e-9) and β_high_flag = -0.112 log-odds (p=5.8e-8), while the public distribution table (`tables/loop012_h4_alt_outcome_distribution.csv`) confirms that 46% of respondents meet the high-anxiety threshold—enough to keep the binary model well powered. These convergent estimates strengthen the case for eventually promoting H4 once additional literature is catalogued.
- Loop 012 also packages the H3 comparison into manuscript-ready artifacts: `tables/loop012_h3_model_summary.csv` quantifies how the multinomial logit improves per-person log-likelihood (-1.72 vs. -2.94) at the cost of 54 slope parameters, while `tables/loop012_h3_classchild_effects.csv` and Figure `figures/loop012_h3_classchild_comparison.png` contrast the PPO’s threshold-specific log-odds with the multinomial marginal effects for each exact wealth bin. The visuals emphasize that childhood class only re-enters the conversation at the ≥$10M PPO cutpoint while multinomial marginal effects stay near zero across the top brackets, bolstering the narrative for retaining PPO as the primary estimator.
- Weighted design remains unavailable, so all exploratory disclosures reiterate the SRS justification and restrict public tables to n≥10 cells.

## 5. Next Steps
1. Draft the H3 PAP promotion package by codifying the PPO estimand, documenting the multinomial comparison, and updating `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md` with the confirmatory test language.
2. Expand the literature/evidence map for H3 and H4 via the Semantic Scholar CLI so each hypothesis has ≥1 additional peer-reviewed citation supporting promotion.
3. Design manuscript-ready tables/figures that juxtapose the new H4 ordinal vs binary anxiety codings, ensuring the sensitivity section can cite deterministic artifacts.
