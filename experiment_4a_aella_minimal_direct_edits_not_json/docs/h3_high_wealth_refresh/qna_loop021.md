*Status:* Open for submissions through 2025-11-15. Entries below capture every vendor question and official response so procurement reviewers can trace timelines and commitments.

## Loop 024 Entries — 2025-11-09
1. **2025-11-09 10:12 UTC — Orion Fieldworks (Singapore)**  
   - *Question:* Can previously fielded affluent-city PSUs (e.g., Singapore + Hong Kong) count toward the ≥30 independent PSUs if the vendor guarantees no respondent overlap with GFS Wave 4?  
   - *Response (10:32 UTC):* Existing PSUs may count **only** if the vendor assigns new PSU IDs that combine city × panel source and certifies (a) zero overlap with Wave 4 PSUs, (b) refreshed recruitment lists post-2024, and (c) independent replicate-weight generation. Appendix B of the RFP now cites `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/LOI_Singapore_2025-11-09.md` as the template for PSU documentation.
2. **2025-11-09 10:40 UTC — NorthBridge Insights (UAE/UK)**  
   - *Question:* Is it acceptable to deliver 32 BRR replicates plus 32 Fay replicates instead of the requested 64 BRR columns?  
   - *Response (11:05 UTC):* No. The refresh must deliver **64 BRR replicate weights** (ρ = 0.5) to maintain parity with the balanced sample. Fay replicates are welcome as a supplement, but they cannot replace the BRR columns. Updated FAQ now references `docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md` so vendors understand how the files will be audited.
