# Request for Proposals — Independent High-Wealth Refresh (Loop 021 Release)

**Issue Date:** 2025-11-09  
**Reference:** H3 Design-Effect Mitigation Plan §3B  
**Point of Contact:** Priya S. (Methods Lead, priya.s@gfs.org)  
**Submission Deadline:** 2025-11-23 23:59 UTC

## 1. Purpose
The Global Flourishing Study (GFS) seeks a survey vendor (or consortium) capable of executing a **5,000-interview refresh** among adults with **≥$10M USD net worth** across **≥30 non-overlapping cities**. Interviews will feed the `childhood_class_networth_ge10m` estimand by creating independent PSUs that lower the design effect from 14.8 toward ≤4.

## 2. Scope of Work
1. **Sample acquisition:** Provide evidence of access to private banking, family office, or comparable high-net-worth panels in ≥30 cities that **do not overlap** the existing balanced sample PSUs. Each country must have its own executed LOI and DocuSign envelope recorded in `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv` so deliverables can be audited per jurisdiction.  
2. **Verification:** Implement asset verification (bank letter, audited statement, or notarized declaration) with rejection/appeal workflows and audit trails. Banker letters + video verifications must be retained for **36 months**; if domestic law imposes shorter retention windows, vendors must execute the cross-border storage waiver in `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/compliance_appendix_loop025.md` and transfer encrypted archives to the GFS vault when the local clock expires. Every verification must be logged in `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/verification_register.csv` within 48 hours, including PSU ID, DocuSign envelope ID, hash type, and SHA-256 hash of the archive.  
3. **PSU & replicate IDs:** Encode PSU = city × vendor, stratum = wealth tier (≥$10M vs. <$10M control group). Produce **one 64-column BRR matrix (Fay ρ = 0.5)** per delivery batch with columns labeled `brr_01` … `brr_64` plus a manifest describing replicate construction (see §5). The PSU lookup table (city, recruiter, sampling list) must be delivered simultaneously; hashed IDs without the lookup table will be marked non-responsive. Appendix C cross-references the live LOI roster (`docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv`) so bidders can mirror the PSU naming convention already accepted by GFS partners.
4. **Questionnaire administration:** Field the standard GFS adulthood wellbeing battery (Forms W5.0) with localized translations as needed, ensuring measurement equivalence.  
5. **Data delivery:** Transmit anonymized microdata, PSU IDs, replicate weights, verification logs, and adjudication notes via the secure SFTP endpoint (`sftp://secure-gfs/replicates/loop021/`).  
6. **Documentation:** Provide interviewer training logs, refusal metrics, incentive protocols, and a privacy impact assessment.

## 4. Pricing Template
Vendors must provide per-interview pricing, verification stipend assumptions, and optional add-ons using `tables/rfp_costing_template.csv`. Total cost may not exceed **$2.2M USD** inclusive of incentives and verification.

## 5. Replicate-Weight Expectations
- Replicates must follow the BRR/Fay format with a **single contiguous 64-column file** labeled `brr_01` … `brr_64`. Splitting the matrix across uploads or altering the column names will be deemed non-responsive because the ingestion tooling (`scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py`) expects this schema.  
- Every submission must include a `manifest.json` containing: PSU definitions, stratum codes, base weights, replicate scaling factors, checksum (SHA-256) for each file, and the command used to generate the replicates.  
- Vendors must certify that replicate generation scripts can be rerun by the GFS Methods team.

## 6. Evaluation Criteria
1. Demonstrated access to ≥$10M respondents in ≥30 independent PSUs (30%).  
2. Quality of verification and privacy safeguards (20%).  
3. Replicate-weight and documentation rigor (20%).  
4. Price competitiveness and schedule feasibility (20%).  
5. Prior experience with sensitive wealth surveys (10%).

## 7. Submission Instructions
- Email complete proposals to `procurement@gfs.org` with subject line `H3 High-Wealth Refresh RFP`.  
- Post the PSU roster and verification workflow diagrams to the secure SFTP folder referenced above.  
- Direct Q&A to Priya S.; consolidated responses will be logged to `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/qna_loop021.md`.

By responding to this RFP, vendors agree to the GFS confidentiality and privacy requirements described in Attachment A.
