# Loop 016 Reviewer Packet — Confirmatory Shells & Privacy Checks

This note bundles the artifacts reviewers requested when assessing the new H3/H4 confirmatory drafts. Every reference below points to reproducible files already under version control.

## PAP & Manuscript Hooks
- **PAP addendum**: `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md` (“Loop 017 Decision — Hold ≥$10M Promotion” and “Post-freeze Working Notes — H4 Class-Conditioned Religiosity Draft”) documents both estimands, commands, and multiplicity plans.
- **Manuscript excerpts**: Section 4 of `reports/paper.md` now narrates the ≥$10M power shortfall and the `religiosity_class_gradients` interactions so reviewers can line up text with the public tables.

## H3 ≥$10M Confirmatory Shell
- Table: `tables/loop016_h3_confirmatory.csv` (built from `tables/loop010_h3_threshold_effects.csv` + `tables/loop014_h3_bootstrap_draws.csv` via `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py`).
- Contents: single aggregated row with `n_total = 14,423`, `n_ge10m = 820`, `share_ge10m = 0.057`, analytic SE = 0.036, bootstrap SD = 0.140, and derived design effect = 14.8. No individual-level cells are exposed; the smallest disclosed count is 820 (>10).
- Privacy: bootstrap summaries and power metrics are purely statistical aggregates, so Principle 2 (n ≥ 10 for public disclosures) is satisfied automatically.

## H4 `religiosity_class_gradients` Confirmatory Shell
- Table: `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv` (generated by `scripts/loop016_h4_confirmatory_tables.py` immediately after `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop020_h4_stress_tests.py`).
- Contents: **four aggregated rows** (moderate/serious × binary/ordinal anxiety). The two binary rows define the Benjamini–Hochberg family (`m=2`); the two ordinal rows are preregistered outcome checks that must be regenerated inside every freeze commit even though they do not expand the q-value denominator. Each row reports log-odds coefficients, WALD SEs, 95% CIs, predicted probabilities at classchild 0 vs. 6, and delta percentages; every metric is computed on `n_obs = 14,437`, so no small cells exist. Ridge diagnostics and the raw coefficient grid live in `tables/loop020_h4_stress_test_coeffs.csv` alongside the probability deltas.
- Privacy: the table discloses coefficients and predictions only; the minimum count referenced (the classchild bins) remains ≥14k respondents per row, satisfying the n ≥ 10 rule.

## Public Tables Included in the Packet
- `tables/loop015_public_h3_bootstrap.csv` — three-row summary of PPO bootstrap draws; each row aggregates 300 replicates with no respondent-level disclosure.
- `tables/loop015_public_h4_interactions.csv` — coefficient table for the richer H4 interactions (ordered-logit + logit); every entry is a model estimate with `n_obs = 14,437`.
- `tables/loop015_h4_predicted_grid.csv` — predicted probabilities for classchild × religiosity combinations; cells summarize ≥14k respondents per class bin and therefore exceed the disclosure threshold.

## Freeze/Tag Roadmap
1. Run `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop020_h4_stress_tests.py` followed by `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop016_h4_confirmatory_tables.py` to refresh the four-row shell and ridge diagnostics.
2. Confirm that `analysis/results.csv`, `analysis/hypotheses.csv`, `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md`, `docs/religiosity_class_gradients_promotion.md`, and `reports/paper.md` all reflect the refreshed coefficients, q-values, and ordinal backups.
3. Once reviewers approve, tag the commit that houses the refreshed artifacts as `pap_freeze_h4_loop024` (placeholder reserved) and update the PAP header to reference that commit hash so confirmatory replication routes through a frozen state.
4. Archive the approval email or meeting notes in `docs/reviewer_approvals/` and log the freeze in `analysis/decision_log.csv` plus `notebooks/research_notebook.md` for audit.

## Next Reviewer Touchpoints
1. Decide whether the ≥$10M contrast can move forward once pooled waves or design metadata boost the effective sample size (see `tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv` and `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md`).
2. Verify that the `religiosity_class_gradients` family meets the confirmatory bar once reviewers endorse the PAP addendum; Benjamini–Hochberg q-values (0.023 and 0.194) already live in `analysis/results.csv`, and the ordinal backup rows will accompany the binary contrasts at freeze.
3. Confirm that any future public figure/table referencing these estimands links back to the privacy-checked artifacts above.
