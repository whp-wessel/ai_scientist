# Letter of Intent — Italy Fieldwork

**Date:** 2025-11-12  
**Partner:** Empiria Luxe Sampling S.r.l. (Italy)  
**GFS Contact:** Priya S. (Methods Lead)  
**Scope:** High-wealth refresh + balanced sample expansion — ≥$10M net-worth tier and matched comparison cases

## Commitments
1. Recruit **≥420 respondents per wave** who satisfy the ≥$10M verification workflow outlined in `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/compliance_appendix_loop025.md`, plus a matched comparison group of 420 respondents below the ≥$10M threshold for stratified variance estimation.  
2. Define PSU IDs as **city × recruiter** with explicit Monaco, Milan, Rome, and Turin strata so none of the new PSUs overlap Wave 4 clusters.  
3. Deliver a **single 64-column BRR matrix (ρ = 0.5)** labeled `brr_01` … `brr_64` together with the PSU lookup table (city, recruiter, sampling list) and checksum manifest at each delivery.  
4. Log banker-letter video verification hashes in `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/verification_register.csv` within 48 hours of each upload to the secure SFTP endpoint.

## Timeline & Deliverables
- Screener localization + IRB submission due **2025-11-19**.  
- Verification pilot (≥40 completes) due **2025-12-08** with deviation log.  
- Full production launch scheduled for **2026-01-25** with weekly KPI dashboards and replicate manifests delivered to `sftp://secure-gfs/replicates/loop021/`.

## Budget & Compliance
- Per-interview ceiling **$455 USD** (includes €125 incentive and verification stipend).  
- Empiria Luxe adopts the cross-border storage waiver in `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/compliance_appendix_loop025.md` for Monaco respondents and agrees to transfer encrypted archives to the GFS vault within 30 days of any domestic retention limit.

LOI remains in effect for Waves 5–7 unless superseded by the forthcoming master services agreement.

## Loop 028 Addendum — 2025-11-12
- DocuSign envelope **b19f-7c** finalized at 09:12 UTC on 2025-11-12. The executed PDF, PSU annex, and checksum log were archived under this file path and referenced inside `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv`.
- Annex B now lists the four Italian PSUs plus the Monaco PSU carve-out promised in the Loop 028 Q&A log; Empiria committed to providing separate DocuSign envelopes for any future Spain expansion.
