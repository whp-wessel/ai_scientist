# Letter of Intent — Spain Fieldwork

**Date:** 2025-11-12  
**Partner:** BarnaLux Insights S.A. (Spain)  
**GFS Contact:** Priya S. (Methods Lead)  
**Scope:** High-wealth refresh + balanced sample expansion — ≥$10M net-worth tier with matched comparison cases

## Commitments
1. Recruit **≥430 respondents per wave** who satisfy the ≥$10M verification workflow described in `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/compliance_appendix_loop025.md`, plus a matched comparison group of 430 respondents in the <$10M tier for stratified variance estimation.  
2. Define PSU IDs as **city × recruiter** for Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, and the Canary Islands, with independent PSU codes for any additional cities proposed post-award. None of the new PSUs may overlap Wave 4 clusters.  
3. Deliver a **single 64-column BRR matrix (ρ = 0.5)** labeled `brr_01` … `brr_64`, co-delivered with the PSU lookup table (city, recruiter, sampling list) and checksum manifest.  
4. Log banker-letter/video verification hashes in `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/verification_register.csv` within 48 hours of each upload to `sftp://secure-gfs/replicates/loop021/`, including DocuSign envelope IDs for every respondent consent artifact.  
5. Maintain distinct DocuSign envelopes for Spain deliverables so procurement can audit per-jurisdiction SLAs; annexes covering Canary Islands PSU additions must be routed within five business days of signature.

## Timeline & Deliverables
- Screener localization + IRB submission due **2025-11-20**.  
- Verification pilot (≥45 completes) due **2025-12-10** with deviation log.  
- Production launch scheduled for **2026-01-28** with weekly KPI dashboards, replicate manifests, and PSU lookup refreshes delivered to the secure SFTP.

## Budget & Compliance
- Per-interview ceiling **$465 USD** (includes €140 incentive and verification stipend).  
- BarnaLux adopts the cross-border storage waiver in `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/compliance_appendix_loop025.md` for Canary Islands respondents and agrees to transfer encrypted archives to the GFS vault within 30 days of any domestic retention limit.

LOI remains in effect for Waves 5–7 unless superseded by the forthcoming master services agreement.

## Loop 029 Addendum — 2025-11-12
- DocuSign envelope **c47a-91** finalized at 15:42 UTC on 2025-11-12. The executed PDF, PSU annex, and checksum log were archived under this file path and recorded in `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv`.
- Annex B lists the five initial PSUs and clarifies that any Canary Islands PSU will ship a dedicated DocuSign annex plus verification hashes logged in `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/verification_register.csv`.

## Loop 030 Addendum — 2025-11-13
- Annex D (filed 09:28 UTC) enumerates the Canary Islands PSU IDs (Las Palmas × recruiter, Santa Cruz × recruiter) and ties them to DocuSign envelope **c47a-91** so Procurement can audit the new geography separately.
- BarnaLux uploaded the first Canary Islands verification batch (`barna/canary_batch01.zip`) to `sftp://secure-gfs/replicates/loop021/`; ledger hash recorded as `vr_2025-11-13_barna_canary01` in `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/verification_register.csv`.
- Future Canary annexes must continue to log ledger hashes within 48 hours and reference Annex D so Methods can reconcile PSU IDs with the BRR lookup when DG-4827 weights arrive.
