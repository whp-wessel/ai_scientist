**Work Summary**
- Built the H1 diagnostics pipeline (`scripts/loop004_h1_diagnostics.py:1-162`) to stage bivariate → controlled OLS plus guidance/gender interactions, and exported shareable tables (`tables/loop004_h1_diagnostics.csv`, `tables/loop004_h1_correlations.csv`) that document the stubborn negative slope and moderating patterns.
- Finalized the ordered-logit and religiosity model specs via `scripts/run_loop004_models.py:1-244`, adding the childhood-class × male contrast for H3 and religiosity × classchild/male interactions for H4; outputs live in `tables/loop004_model_estimates.csv` and feed new result rows (`analysis/results.csv:10-19`).
- Extended the PAP with a Loop 004 section plus an explicit Benjamini–Hochberg plan for each hypothesis family (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:69-93`), and updated the hypothesis register to note the moderation focus (`analysis/hypotheses.csv:2`).
- Refreshed the manuscript narrative with the new diagnostics and interaction interpretations (`reports/paper.md:12-30`), logged the sprint in the research notebook (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:38-42`) and decision log (`analysis/decision_log.csv:10`), and recorded next actions in `artifacts/state.json`.

**Testing**
- `python scripts/loop004_h1_diagnostics.py`
- `python scripts/run_loop004_models.py`

**Next Steps**
1. Decide which H1 contrasts (main vs. moderation) will be marked confirmatory, then lock them in the PAP/hypothesis register before freezing.
2. Freeze/tag the PAP and rerun `scripts/run_loop004_models.py` with recorded seeds to capture confirmatory estimates, then apply the BH plan outlined in `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`.
3. Propagate the multiplicity language and confirmatory claims into `reports/paper.md` once the PAP is frozen.
