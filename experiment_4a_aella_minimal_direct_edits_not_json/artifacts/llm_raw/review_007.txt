DECISION: STOP – loops 4–7 have no decision-log or notebook entries, breaking the reproducibility invariant.

R1 FAIL – analysis/decision_log.csv:7 stops at loop_002 while artifacts/state.json:4 records loop_counter=7, and notebooks/research_notebook.md:31 ends at loop003, so the confirmatory freeze and sensitivity work lack any logged commands/seeds.

R2 PASS – analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1 locks the PAP with BH/FDR rules, and analysis/results.csv:20 & 22 plus scripts/loop007_h1_sensitivity.py:1 and analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:1 document the confirmatory estimates, q-values, and robustness specs with explicit commands and SRS justifications.

R3 PASS – lit/evidence_map.csv:2 and lit/bibliography.md:1 list DOI-tracked sources tied to stored Semantic Scholar queries (e.g., lit/queries/loop_007/query_001.json), giving each claim verifiable citations.

R4 PASS – tables/loop006_h1_confirmatory.csv:1 and tables/loop007_h1_sensitivity.csv:1 publish only aggregate coefficients with n≈14k, so the n<10 privacy rule is respected.

R5 WARN – Key artifacts exist (frozen PAP, manuscript updates), but the missing loop-by-loop entries in notebooks/research_notebook.md:31 leave the deliverable set incomplete.

Notes: Please backfill decision_log/notebook entries for loops 3–7 (with commands/seeds) before continuing.
