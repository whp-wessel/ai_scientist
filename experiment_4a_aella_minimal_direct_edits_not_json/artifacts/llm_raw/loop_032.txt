**Loop 032 Update**
- Kept the DG-4827 audit trail current by rerunning `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py --manifest docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md` (still “missing roles: brr, psu, weights”) and logging the result across the manifest, design-effect plan, and notebook so every rehearsal since 2025-11-12 is traceable (`docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:65-78`, `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:75-80`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:284-292`).
- Documented the daily procurement sweep—still no new vendor Q&A, annexes, or ledgers—so the compliance trail remains unbroken going into the 2025-11-15 deadline (`docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/qna_loop021.md:61-65`).
- Updated the governance artifacts so the loop is auditable: appended the decision log, bumped `artifacts/state.json`, and staged the next commit message (`analysis/decision_log.csv:73`, `artifacts/state.json:9-14`, `artifacts/git_message.txt:1`).
- CLI metadata refreshed automatically when the loop ran; `artifacts/repro_report.md:1-7` and `artifacts/session_info.txt:1-9` now capture the latest timestamp/Git head for reproducibility bookkeeping.

Next steps:
1. Stay on the DG-4827 watch: paste the checksum email into `docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/dg-4827_checksums_2025-11-16.txt`, rerun the ingestion script, then fire `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py --use-weights` immediately after the AES-256 drop lands.
2. Execute the `religiosity_class_gradients` freeze (rerun Loop 020 stress tests, regenerate `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv`, flip PAP/results to `confirmatory=TRUE`, tag `pap_freeze_h4_loop024`) as soon as Dr. M. Mendez grants formal approval.
3. Continue the daily high-wealth procurement sweeps—log any late Q&A, Spain Canary Islands annex changes, or Norway Reykjavik ledger uploads within 48 hours in the Q&A log, LOI register, and verification register.
