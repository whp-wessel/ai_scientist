**Updates**
- Expanded the H3 clustered bootstrap to cover the ≥$10M tier by adding the cutpoint to `scripts/loop014_h3_cluster_bootstrap.py:22-26` and ordering the summaries (`scripts/loop014_h3_cluster_bootstrap.py:177-220`). The rerun (`tables/loop014_h3_bootstrap_summary.csv`) now feeds a focused PAP addendum (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:44-49,97-99`) plus an updated hypothesis note (`analysis/hypotheses.csv:4`) and results entry (`analysis/results.csv:37`). A reviewer-ready digest lives in `tables/loop015_public_h3_bootstrap.csv`.
- Documented the new bootstrap evidence inside `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:63-68`, clarifying why the ≥$10M contrast is the only viable confirmatory candidate while the lower thresholds remain descriptive.
- Built `scripts/loop015_h4_rich_interactions.py:1-274` to add `classcurrent` and religiosity dummies, re-estimate both the ordered-logit and high-anxiety logits, and emit the richer coefficient table plus prediction grid/figure (`tables/loop015_h4_interactions_rich.csv`, `tables/loop015_h4_predicted_grid.csv`, `figures/loop015_h4_classinteraction.png`). The public-facing coefficient bundle lives in `tables/loop015_public_h4_interactions.csv`, and the key interaction estimates were logged in `analysis/results.csv:38-40`.
- Updated the manuscript’s exploratory narrative to describe the H3 pivot and H4 robustness (`reports/paper.md:31-33`), refreshed `notebooks/research_notebook.md:122-133` with a Loop 015 record/next steps, and appended the loop to `analysis/decision_log.csv:38`.
- Synced project state so downstream loops know what’s next (`artifacts/state.json`) and staged a commit message in `artifacts/git_message.txt`.

**Tests**
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop014_h3_cluster_bootstrap.py --n-reps 300`
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop015_h4_rich_interactions.py`

**Next Steps**
1. Quantify effective sample size and power for the ≥$10M H3 contrast (bootstrap precision + analytic SEs) before drafting confirmatory tables.
2. Finish the H4 literature/PAP addendum around the moderate-practice × classchild estimand and lay out the multiplicity plan.
3. Prototype confirmatory-ready public tables for the H3 ≥$10M contrast and the H4 class interaction so the reviewer can audit formats next loop.
