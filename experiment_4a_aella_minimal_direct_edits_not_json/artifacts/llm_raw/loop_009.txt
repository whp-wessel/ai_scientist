**Updates**
- Built a reproducible H1 visualization pipeline (`scripts/loop009_h1_visuals.py:1-206`) that reloads the preregistered guidance/gender interaction models, generates ±2.5 SD abuse grids, computes prediction intervals, and emits both a public table and dual-panel plot (`figures/loop009_h1_confirmatory_interactions.png`) without touching raw records.
- Published the underlying disclosure-safe grid (`tables/loop009_h1_interaction_grid.csv:1-5`) so every plotted point carries its 95 % CI and the full n≈14 k backing it, then cited the figure/table inside the Confirmatory Findings section and rewrote the Next Steps queue around the remaining backlog (`reports/paper.md:21-36`).
- Narrated the loop in the research log (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:75-80`), appended the reproducibility row to the decision log (`analysis/decision_log.csv:27`), refreshed the state tracker with loop_counter = 9 plus the updated next actions (`artifacts/state.json:3-9`), and staged the checkpoint message (`artifacts/git_message.txt`).

**Testing**
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop009_h1_visuals.py`

**Next Steps**
1. Prototype partial proportional-odds or multinomial net-worth models to resolve the H3 proportional-odds violations.
2. Design the next H1 robustness wave (bootstrap CIs and/or alternative anxiety codings) ahead of the sensitivity phase.
3. Expand the H2–H3 literature/measurement dossier so any future PAP promotion rests on peer-reviewed support.
