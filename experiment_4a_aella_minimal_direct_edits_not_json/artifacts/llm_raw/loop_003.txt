**Updates**
- Automated the Likert polarity workflow via a shared helper plus the new audit script (`scripts/likert_utils.py:1`, `scripts/loop003_scale_audit.py:1`), and published the flip/z-score diagnostics for every H1–H4 item (`tables/loop003_likert_alignment.csv:2`). The hypothesis register now states that these z-scores embody “higher = more intensity” for each construct (`analysis/hypotheses.csv:2`), and Sumin (2022) was added as the methodological citation to both the bibliography and evidence map (`lit/bibliography.md:12`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:9`).
- Rebuilt the modeling pipeline to consume the aligned scales, adding the ordered-logit wealth spec plus paired OLS/logit religiosity→anxiety models (`scripts/run_loop003_models.py:1`). Full coefficient tables live under `tables/loop003_model_estimates.csv:1`, while the key effects (e.g., H1’s still-negative slope and H4’s protective religiosity signal) are captured in `analysis/results.csv:5`–`analysis/results.csv:9`.
- Propagated the measurement/model changes through the governance artifacts so the confirmatory plan can be frozen next: PAP update (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:63`), codebook note (`docs/codebook_priority.md:62`), manuscript methods/results/next-steps (`reports/paper.md:12`, `reports/paper.md:17`, `reports/paper.md:26`), notebook log (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:31`), and the decision log entry for this loop (`analysis/decision_log.csv:8`).
- Advanced the run state to the PAP phase with a fresh action list centered on probing the anomalous H1 slope, finalizing estimands, and codifying the multiplicity plan (`artifacts/state.json:2-11`).

- Tests: `python scripts/loop003_scale_audit.py`; `python scripts/run_loop003_models.py`

**Next Steps**
1. Diagnose why the aligned childhood-abuse coefficient remains negative (e.g., replicate the audit on related abuse items or add interaction terms) before elevating H1 to confirmatory status—`tables/loop003_model_estimates.csv:1` highlights the current sign.
2. Finalize the ordered-logit and religiosity specifications (including any pre-registered interactions/multiplicity controls) so the PAP can be frozen/tagged per the plan in `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:63` and `artifacts/state.json:5-8`.
