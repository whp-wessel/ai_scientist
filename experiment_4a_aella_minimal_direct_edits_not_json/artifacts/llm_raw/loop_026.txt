**Summary**
- Re-ran the DG-4827 ingestion command (still returning “missing roles: brr, psu, weights”) and logged the time-stamped rerun plus standing instructions in both the manifest and design-effect plan so auditors see the pipeline is primed but still blocked (`docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:45`, `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:75`).
- Extended the high-wealth RFP evidence trail: new Loop 026 Q&A entries spell out the 36-month retention rule and single 64-column BRR delivery, the compliance appendix now carries the cross-border storage waiver text, and the RFP mirrors those requirements so vendors can’t claim ambiguity (`docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/qna_loop021.md:21`, `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/compliance_appendix_loop025.md:7`, `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/rfp_2025-11-09.md:13`, `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/rfp_2025-11-09.md:32`).
- Recorded newly countersigned LOIs from Australia and Canada—both the register and partner memos list DocuSign IDs/timestamps so the expanded-cluster evidence is auditable (`docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv:7`, `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv:8`, `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/LOI_Australia_2025-11-09.md:27`, `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/LOI_Canada_2025-11-09.md:27`).
- Updated the research log, decision log, state snapshot, and commit message so this loop’s actions (ingestion check + procurement updates) are reproducible (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:224`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:60`, `artifacts/state.json:9`, `artifacts/git_message.txt:1`).

**Tests**
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py --manifest docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md` (blocked until DG-4827 ships PSU IDs, weights, and BRR replicates).

**Next Steps**
1. As soon as the AES-256 bundle arrives (target 2025-11-16), paste the checksum email into `docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/dg-4827_checksums_2025-11-16.txt`, rerun the ingestion script, and refresh `tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv` via `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py --use-weights`.
2. When Dr. Mendez grants approval, rerun the H4 stress-test → confirmatory-table pipeline and freeze/tag `pap_freeze_h4_loop024`, flipping the relevant hypothesis/result rows to `confirmatory=TRUE`.
3. Keep appending every vendor Q&A thread and LOI movement before the 2025-11-15 Q&A deadline so the design-effect mitigation evidence stays continuous.
