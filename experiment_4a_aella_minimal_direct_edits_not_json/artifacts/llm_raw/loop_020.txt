**Summary**
- `scripts/loop020_h4_stress_tests.py:1` now runs the binary, ridge (α=5), and ordinal religiosity × class interactions end-to-end and writes the coefficient/probability tables (`tables/loop020_h4_stress_test_coeffs.csv:1`, `tables/loop020_h4_highflag_prob_deltas.csv:1`, `tables/loop020_h4_ord3_prob_deltas.csv:1`, `tables/loop020_h4_ridge_prob_deltas.csv:1`); the conclusions are recorded in `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:104` and `notebooks/research_notebook.md:162`, showing the serious-practice term stays negative across shrinkage and alternative anxiety codings.
- The confirmatory infrastructure now ingests those outputs: `scripts/loop016_h4_confirmatory_tables.py:1` produces four rows (moderate/serious × binary/ordinal) in `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv:1`, while `analysis/results.csv:48`, `analysis/hypotheses.csv:7`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:105`, `docs/religiosity_class_gradients_promotion.md:8`, `docs/loop016_reviewer_packet.md:15`, `reports/paper.md:33`, and `analysis/decision_log.csv:48` all reference the ridge/ordinal evidence, keeping the manuscript, PAP, and reviewer packet synchronized.
- H3 now has a concrete growth roadmap: `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:1` translates the Loop 018 diagnostics (`analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:96`) into new-country, independent high-wealth, and replicate-weight actions, and the plan is reflected in the PAP (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:105`) plus `artifacts/state.json:9` so the ≥$10M contrast can work toward confirmatory power.

**Testing**
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop020_h4_stress_tests.py`

**Next Steps**
1. Execute the H3 acquisition/metadata plan in `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:22` so the ≥$10M PPO contrast gains the effective n and reduced design effect it needs.
2. Update the PAP addendum and reviewer packet (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:115`, `docs/loop016_reviewer_packet.md:15`) to lock in the four-row H4 shell and outline the freeze/tag workflow for `religiosity_class_gradients`.
3. Draft the reviewer-facing summary that packages the ridge/ordinal stress tests (`analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:104`) and multiplicity handling before requesting confirmatory approval.
