**Loop 028 Updates**
- Kept the DG‑4827 ingestion trail current by rerunning `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py --manifest docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md` (stderr still reports missing PSU/weight/BRR files) and documenting the 16:45 UTC check inside the manifest (`docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:55-58`) plus the design-effect plan snapshot (`docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:117-123`). The status tables in `tables/loop021_h3_weight_delivery_status.csv` and `tables/loop021_h3_weighted_summary.csv` were refreshed so auditors can see the newest timestamp.
- Expanded the procurement audit trail: added Loop 028 Q&A entries covering the per-country DocuSign rule and the 48-hour verification-hash log (`docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/qna_loop021.md:37-43`), updated the RFP scope to require LOI-by-country plus the new hash register (`docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/rfp_2025-11-09.md:11-16`), and created the register scaffold itself (`docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/verification_register.csv:1`) so vendors know exactly where to log SHA‑256 records.
- Logged Empiria Luxe’s Italy countersignature by drafting a dedicated LOI (`docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/LOI_Italy_2025-11-12.md:1-32`) and appending it to the master register with DocuSign envelope b19f-7c and the Monaco PSU carve-out note (`docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv:1-10`), bringing the roster to nine executed jurisdictions.
- Updated reproducibility artifacts so the loop is auditable: decision log (`analysis/decision_log.csv:64`), notebook narrative (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:243-251`), state snapshot with refreshed next actions (`artifacts/state.json:1-15`), and the requested commit message stub (`artifacts/git_message.txt`).

**Tests**
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py --manifest docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md` (still blocked until DG delivers PSU/weight/BRR bundles).

**Next Steps**
1. Paste the DG‑4827 checksum list the moment the AES-256 drop arrives (target 2025-11-16), rerun the ingestion script, then execute `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py --use-weights` to refresh `tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv`.
2. Freeze the `religiosity_class_gradients` family as soon as Dr. Mendez issues the written go (rerun Loop 020 stress tests, rebuild `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv`, flip PAP/hypotheses/results, tag `pap_freeze_h4_loop024`).
3. Keep daily procurement monitoring through the 2025-11-15 Q&A close—log new vendor exchanges, Spain/Norway LOIs with DocuSign IDs, and any verification-register hashes so the mitigation plan remains fully auditable.
