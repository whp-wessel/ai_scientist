**Highlights**
- PAP is formally frozen and documented: `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-63` captures the status (`status: frozen`), the new tag/hash (`pap_freeze_loop006 @ 932b5aa…`), confirmatory scope, BH plan, and deterministic commands, while `analysis/hypotheses.csv:1-5` now flags H1 as the lone confirmatory family tied to those interactions.
- Confirmatory H1 coefficients were regenerated with the recorded seed and logged in both the public table `tables/loop006_h1_confirmatory.csv:1-3` and the registry `analysis/results.csv:20-21`, including BH-adjusted q-values (4.6e-16 for guidance buffering; 5.8e-11 for male vulnerability) and full SRS notes.
- Manuscript and documentation narrate the frozen design and results: `reports/paper.md:6-33` now leads with the PAP freeze, BH control, and literature-backed moderation findings; `notebooks/research_notebook.md:49-54`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:15`, and `artifacts/state.json:2-12` record the loop actions, phase shift to analysis, and next-action stack.

**Testing**
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop004_h1_diagnostics.py`
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop005_h1_simple_slopes.py`
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/run_loop004_models.py`

**Next Steps**
1. Run sensitivity checks for the H1 family (e.g., HC3 SEs, alternative covariates) and summarize them in `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md`.
2. Deepen diagnostics/literature for H2–H4 to decide if any estimands are ready for promotion in the next PAP freeze.
3. Build manuscript-ready visuals/tables (interaction plots) for the confirmatory contrasts while keeping public exports compliant with the n≥10 privacy rule.
