DECISION: CONTINUE
R1 PASS – Decision log, notebook, and state files document actions, tooling, and seeds so another analyst can replay the loop (analysis/decision_log.csv:1-5; notebooks/research_notebook.md:3-21; artifacts/state.json:1-12).
R2 PASS – Survey design is explicitly handled via an SRS justification and the PAP spells out estimands, covariates, and hypothesis linkage with supporting codebook stats (analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:5-55; analysis/hypotheses.csv:1-5; docs/codebook_priority.md:5-60; tables/loop001_numeric_descriptives.csv:1-7).
R3 PASS – Literature tracking includes DOI-cited sources tied to stored Semantic Scholar queries and mapped to hypotheses (lit/bibliography.md:3-14; lit/evidence_map.csv:1-6).
R4 PASS – Public tables respect the n≥10 rule (smallest cell 135) and this privacy stance is reiterated in the PAP (tables/loop001_categorical_counts.csv:1-22; analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:47-51).
R5 FAIL – The mandated manuscript scaffold `reports/paper.md` has not been created, leaving the required deliverable set incomplete (reports/).

Notes: Add the missing `reports/paper.md` (and the expected commit message file) before the next loop so checkpoints can proceed cleanly.
