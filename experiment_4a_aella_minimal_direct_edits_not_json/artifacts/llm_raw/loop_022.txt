**Loop 022 Outcomes**
- Filed the promised H3 evidence bundle: the eight-country LOI register anchors the new `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/` packet (`docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv:1`), the independent high-wealth refresh RFP/Q&A and costing worksheet document vendor expectations (`docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/rfp_2025-11-09.md:1`, `tables/rfp_costing_template.csv:1`), and the replicate-weight delivery manifest now tracks ticket DG-4827 plus checksum placeholders (`docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:1`).
- Extended the design-effect roadmap with an evidence table and PAP-freeze workplan (`docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:80` & `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:86`), and referenced those assets inside the frozen PAP so future auditors can trace the ≥$10M promotion path (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:44`).
- Updated the reviewer packet to point explicitly at the new evidence folders before the next audit checkpoint (`docs/loop016_reviewer_packet.md:30`).
- Synced the manuscript’s exploratory section with the four-row `religiosity_class_gradients` shell, BH q-values, and refreshed next-actions so it mirrors the PAP/reviewer packet (`reports/paper.md:33`).
- Logged the loop and narrative updates (`analysis/decision_log.csv:52`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:182`) and refreshed the state snapshot/commit message for the runner (`artifacts/state.json:9`, `artifacts/git_message.txt`).

Tests: not run (documentation-only loop).

**Next Steps**
1. Ingest the replicate-weight drop (DG-4827) and rerun `scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py` plus `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py --use-weights` to refresh the ≥$10M design-effect tables.
2. Execute the `religiosity_class_gradients` freeze once reviewers approve by regenerating the four-row shell, updating `analysis/hypotheses.csv`/`analysis/results.csv`, and tagging `pap_freeze_h4_loop024`.
3. Keep the LOI/RFP evidence current—log vendor Q&A and any partner status shifts inside `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv` and the decision log before the next loop.
