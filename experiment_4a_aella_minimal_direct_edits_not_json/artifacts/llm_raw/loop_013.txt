**Key Updates**
- Privacy fix: suppressed the <10 anxiety counts in `tables/loop012_h4_alt_outcome_distribution.csv:5-8`, resolving the Non‑negotiable alert before proceeding. Logged the remediation (and everything else) via `analysis/decision_log.csv:34` so auditors can see the command history.
- H3 promotion draft: added a post-freeze addendum that formalizes the PPO estimand, reproducibility commands, multinomial benchmark, and literature rationale (Chan & Boliver, 2013; Glei et al., 2022) in `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:69-99`, with matching citations captured in `lit/bibliography.md:19-21` and `lit/evidence_map.csv:16-18`. The manuscript now references the new PPO vs. multinomial story and cites the added sources in `reports/paper.md:21-38` and `reports/paper.md:40-45`.
- H4 outcome comparison assets: created `scripts/loop013_h4_visuals.py:1-107`, which aggregates religiosity coefficients across all anxiety codings into `tables/loop013_h4_outcome_effects.csv:1-6` and `figures/loop013_h4_outcome_effects.png`; the sensitivity log (`analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:57-61`) and manuscript (`reports/paper.md:21-38`) now point at these deterministic artifacts and cite Kasen et al. (2014)/Shiah et al. (2015).
- Documentation/state: captured the loop narrative in `notebooks/research_notebook.md:105-110`, refreshed `artifacts/state.json:3-9` next actions, and recorded the checkpoint message in `artifacts/git_message.txt:1`.

**Tests**

**Next Steps**
1. Run clustered bootstraps for the PPO estimator and lock the ≥$100k/≥$1MM H3 contrasts before proposing another PAP freeze.
2. Broaden the H4 literature base (post‑2018) and probe class/gender interactions on the ordinal and ≥5 binary anxiety outcomes ahead of any preregistration attempt.
3. Embed the new H3/H4 tables/figures directly into the manuscript’s results/sensitivity sections and stage confirmatory-ready public tables for reviewer scrutiny.
