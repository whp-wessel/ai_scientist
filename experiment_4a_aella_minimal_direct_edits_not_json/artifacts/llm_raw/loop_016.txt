**Updates**
- `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py:1` now regenerates the ≥$10M PPO sample diagnostics and outputs `tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv` + `tables/loop016_h3_confirmatory.csv`, showing only 820 usable cases, a design effect of 14.8, and cluster-adjusted power ≈0.16; those stats are woven into the PAP addendum (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:97`), sensitivity record (`analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:79`), manuscript narrative (`reports/paper.md:32`), and the Loop 016 notebook entry (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:132`).
- `scripts/loop016_h4_confirmatory_tables.py:1` distills the moderate/serious practice × classchild coefficients into `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv`, including predicted high-anxiety probabilities at classchild 0 vs. 6. The PAP now spells out the proposed `religiosity_class_gradients` family (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:105`), the sensitivity log documents the findings (`analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:85`), the manuscript references the new public table (`reports/paper.md:33`), and the hypothesis register highlights the promotion draft (`analysis/hypotheses.csv:4`–5).
- A fresh Semantic Scholar pull (`lit/queries/loop_016/query_003.json`) adds Bruce et al. (2024) to both `lit/bibliography.md:23` and `lit/evidence_map.csv:20`, supplying the class-sensitive religiosity citation that underpins the new H4 estimand.
- Documentation and statekeeping are up to date: the decision log captures the loop (`analysis/decision_log.csv:40`), the research notebook narrates the work (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:132`), and `artifacts/state.json:2` records Loop 016 plus the refreshed next-actions list.

**Tests**
- `python scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py`
- `python scripts/loop016_h4_confirmatory_tables.py`

**Next**
1. Decide whether to proceed with the ≥$10M H3 confirmatory contrast despite 0.16 cluster-adjusted power or pursue additional sampling/pooled waves.
2. Wire the `religiosity_class_gradients` family into `analysis/results.csv` with BH scaffolding so the moderate/serious interactions can move toward confirmatory status.
3. Assemble the reviewer packet (PAP addendum, confirm tables, manuscript excerpts) demonstrating that the new Loop 016 tables comply with the n≥10 disclosure rule.
