**Highlights**
- Reran `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py --manifest docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md`, logged the unchanged “missing roles: brr, psu, weights” result, and captured the 2025‑11‑12 timestamp in both the manifest and the design-effect tracker so auditors can see the daily DG-4827 monitoring trail (`docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:60`, `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:77`, `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:128`).
- Added Loop 029 procurement evidence: new IberBarna and Aurora Nordisk Q&A exchanges document the per-country DocuSign rule and batched hash logging, while the first verification-register entry shows a 22-case SHA-256 bundle tied to the Norway LOI and secure vault location (`docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/qna_loop021.md:45`, `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/verification_register.csv:2`, `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/rfp_2025-11-09.md:12`).
- Spain and Norway now have full LOI packets with PSU/verification commitments, DocuSign IDs, and annex expectations; the register reflects eleven executed jurisdictions and the manuscript cites these additions when explaining the H3 mitigation pathway (`docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/LOI_Spain_2025-11-12.md:1`, `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/LOI_Norway_2025-11-12.md:1`, `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv:11`, `reports/paper.md:20`, `reports/paper.md:34`).
- Reproducibility artefacts now describe the loop: the notebook narrates the DG-4827 rerun plus procurement actions, the decision log records the commands/outputs, and the state file advances to loop 29 with refreshed next actions; commit message prepared in `artifacts/git_message.txt` (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:252`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:67`, `artifacts/state.json:9`).

**Next Steps**
1. Keep rerunning the DG-4827 ingestion rehearsal until the targeted 2025‑11‑16 drop, then paste the checksum list, regenerate the weighted panel, and run `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py --use-weights`.
2. Await Dr. Mendez’s approval before freezing the `religiosity_class_gradients` family (rerun stress tests, flip confirmatory flags, update PAP/manuscript, and tag `pap_freeze_h4_loop024`).
3. Maintain daily procurement surveillance through the 2025‑11‑15 Q&A deadline—capture any new Spain/Norway annexes, additional LOIs, and verification-hash batches within 48 hours as committed in the register/RFP.
