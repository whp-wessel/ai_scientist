**Loop 031 Update**
- Re-ran the daily DG-4827 rehearsal (`PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py --manifest docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md`), logged the blocked output, and captured a new Loop 031 status block so auditors see the 2025‑11‑13 timestamp and the standing post-drop plan (`docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:70-73`).
- The audit tables refreshed but still show every required file missing, keeping the trail deterministic for reviewers (`tables/loop021_h3_weight_delivery_status.csv:2-6`, `tables/loop021_h3_weighted_summary.csv:2`).

**Procurement Watch**
- Documented today’s procurement inbox sweep—no new vendor Q&A, annexes, or ledgers since the Spain/Norway submissions—so the 2025‑11‑15 deadline compliance is observable (`docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/qna_loop021.md:61`).

**Traceability**
- Notebook now narrates Loop 031 actions, seeds, and follow-on tasks (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:273-281`); the decision log row links inputs/commands/outputs (`analysis/decision_log.csv:71`); and `artifacts/state.json` reflects loop_counter 31 plus refreshed next actions/time stamp (`artifacts/state.json:9-14`). Commit message staged in `artifacts/git_message.txt`.

**Next Steps**
1. Keep the DG-4827 rehearsal running daily; once the AES-256 bundle + checksum email land, paste the email into `docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/dg-4827_checksums_2025-11-16.txt`, rerun the ingestion script, and immediately execute `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py --use-weights` so `tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv` carries weighted SEs.
2. Freeze the `religiosity_class_gradients` family as soon as Dr. M. Mendez approves by rerunning the Loop 020 stress tests, regenerating `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv`, flipping PAP/hypothesis/results rows to `confirmatory=TRUE`, and tagging `pap_freeze_h4_loop024`.
3. Continue daily high-wealth monitoring through the Nov 15 Q&A deadline, logging any new vendor questions or Spain/Norway annex/ledger deliveries within 48 hours.
