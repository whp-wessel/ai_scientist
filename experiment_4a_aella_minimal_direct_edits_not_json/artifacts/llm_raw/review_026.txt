DECISION: CONTINUE
R1 PASS – Loop actions and commands are logged (`analysis/decision_log.csv:60`) and mirrored in the manifest entry that records the exact rerun plus follow-on instructions (`docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:45`), preserving reproducibility traces with the default seed.  
R2 PASS – No new estimates were produced; the weighting status table continues to show every required file as missing (`tables/loop021_h3_weight_delivery_status.csv:2`) and the design-effect plan documents the blocked condition and rerun sequence (`docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:75`).  
R3 PASS – This loop only updated operational evidence, while the literature/evidence register remains intact with peer-reviewed sources (`lit/evidence_map.csv:2`); procurement Q&A entries link requirements back to the RFP/compliance appendix for verifiable context (`docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/qna_loop021.md:21`).  
R4 PASS – Public outputs are limited to logistics tables (presence flags) and country-level LOI counts far above suppression thresholds, so no n<10 disclosures occur (`tables/loop021_h3_weight_delivery_status.csv:2`, `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv:2`).  
R5 PASS – Required artifacts stay synchronized: the notebook narrates Loop 026 work and next steps (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:224`), `artifacts/state.json:9` captures the updated phase/backlog, and the manifest/register updates landed in `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv:7` and related docs.
