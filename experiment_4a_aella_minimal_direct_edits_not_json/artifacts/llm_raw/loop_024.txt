**Updates**
- Logged the DG-4827 follow-up so auditors know why the weighting pipeline is still blocked: the manifest now captures the 2025-11-09 ETA plus rerun instructions and points to the checksum stub (`docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:33-37`; `docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/dg-4827_checksums_2025-11-16.txt:1`). The design-effect plan adds a Loop 024 status snapshot linking the manifest, Q&A log, and LOIs to the ≥$10M mitigation stream (`docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:99-104`).
- Tracked procurement artifacts: the high-wealth RFP log now includes the first two vendor questions with PSU/replicate clarifications (`docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/qna_loop021.md:5-11`), the LOI register records which partners have countersigned and which remain in legal review (`docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv:1-9`), and the manuscript explicitly references these living artifacts so reviewers can follow the evidence trail (`reports/paper.md:20` & `reports/paper.md:34`).
- Prepared the religiosity_class_gradients freeze packet by adding a checklist of pending tasks/owners (`docs/religiosity_class_gradients_promotion.md:54-63`) and opening the reviewer approval log that will house Dr. Mendez’s sign-off before tagging `pap_freeze_h4_loop024` (`docs/reviewer_approvals/religiosity_class_gradients_loop024.md:1-9`).
- Synced governance artifacts: notebook + decision log narrate the new DG, RFP, and H4 actions while state.json and the git message capture the updated backlog (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:203-212`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:56`, `artifacts/state.json:9-15`, `artifacts/git_message.txt`).

**Testing**
- Not run (documentation-only changes).

**Next Steps**
1. Take delivery of the DG-4827 replicate bundles (target 2025-11-16), drop the checksum file under `docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/`, rerun `scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py`, and refresh `tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv` via `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py --use-weights`.
2. Execute the `religiosity_class_gradients` freeze as soon as the reviewer approves: rerun the Loop 020 stress tests, update `analysis/hypotheses.csv`/`analysis/results.csv`, rewrite the PAP header, and tag `pap_freeze_h4_loop024`.
3. Continue daily monitoring of the high-wealth RFP Q&A inbox and LOI statuses, appending every question/response and countersigned document to the tracked files ahead of the 2025-11-15 Q&A cutoff.
