**DG-4827 Status**
- `docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:65` now records the Loop 030 rehearsal, confirming the ingestion script still blocks on missing PSU/weight/BRR files and documenting the exact rerun chain once the checksum email arrives.
- `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:129` expands the status table with the 2025-11-13 timestamp and reiterates the post-delivery plan to immediately rerun `scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py` followed by the weighted power script.
- `reports/paper.md:21` mirrors this by describing the daily rehearsal protocol so the manuscript stays aligned with the mitigation workflow, and `artifacts/state.json:9` bumps the loop counter plus next-action list to reflect the same priorities.

**Procurement & Compliance**
- `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/qna_loop021.md:53` logs the new vendor rulings for Spain’s Canary Islands annex and Norway’s Reykjavik batch logging so every PSU question is auditable.
- `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/verification_register.csv:3` adds the Canary Islands hash ledger and `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/verification_register.csv:4` adds the Reykjavik batch, satisfying the 48-hour logging rule cited in the Q&A.
- `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv:11` and `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv:12` now reference the new annex evidence, with the underlying LOIs updated at `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/LOI_Spain_2025-11-12.md:35` and `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/LOI_Norway_2025-11-12.md:35`.
- `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:131`–`132` and `reports/paper.md:22` cite these annexes so reviewers can trace how Spain/Norway compliance feeds the pending ≥$10M promotion.

**Repro Artifacts**
- `analysis/decision_log.csv:69` and `notebooks/research_notebook.md:262` document the loop’s commands, evidence, and remaining blockers.
- `artifacts/state.json:9` captures the updated timestamp/next steps, and `artifacts/git_message.txt` holds the checkpoint message for the runner.

**Tests**
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py --manifest docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md` → “Replicate ingestion blocked; missing roles: brr, psu, weights” (expected while DG-4827 files remain undelivered).

Next steps:
1. Paste the DG-4827 checksum email into `docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/dg-4827_checksums_2025-11-16.txt`, rerun the ingestion script, and immediately refresh `tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv` with `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py --use-weights`.
2. Execute the `religiosity_class_gradients` freeze as soon as Dr. Mendez issues written approval (regenerate `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv`, flip the registry rows, update the PAP header, and tag `pap_freeze_h4_loop024`).
3. Keep logging every high-wealth vendor Q&A, annex, and verification ledger (especially Spain Canary Islands and Norway Reykjavik) within 48 hours so procurement reviewers can verify compliance ahead of the 2025-11-15 deadline.
