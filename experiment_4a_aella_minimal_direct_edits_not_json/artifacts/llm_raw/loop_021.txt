**Key Updates**
- Built the Loop 021 operational tracker for the ≥$10M design-effect workstream so reviewers can see concrete partner, high-wealth refresh, and replicate-weight actions, along with named owners and required evidence drops (`docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:57-74`).
- Reframed the PAP addendum and reviewer packet to emphasize the four-row `religiosity_class_gradients` shell, spell out that BH still uses the two binary contrasts, and enumerate the exact rerun + tagging protocol culminating in `pap_freeze_h4_loop024` (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:111-137`, `docs/loop016_reviewer_packet.md:14-33`).
- Extended the promotion memo and sensitivity notes with a Loop 021 reviewer summary so the ridge/ordinal stress tests, multiplicity handling, and freeze-readiness narrative are packaged without rerunning code (`docs/religiosity_class_gradients_promotion.md:49-52`, `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:112-120`).
- Logged the sprint in the decision log/notebook, updated project state and next actions, and queued the commit message for the runner (`analysis/decision_log.csv:50`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:173-181`, `artifacts/state.json:9-18`, `artifacts/git_message.txt:1`). No new models or tests were executed this loop—work was documentation-only.

**Next Steps**
- Collect the promised partner LOIs, RFP packet, and replicate manifest so the H3 tracker has auditable evidence to cite.
- Sync `reports/paper.md` (and any supporting tables/figures) with the four-row H4 shell story now locked into the PAP and reviewer materials.
- Start drafting the PAP-freeze workplan for `childhood_class_networth_ge10m` once the design-effect mitigation milestones solidify.
