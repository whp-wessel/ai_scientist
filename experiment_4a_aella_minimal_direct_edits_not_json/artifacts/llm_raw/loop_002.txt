**Loop 002 Deliverables**
- Extended the variable infrastructure to cover teen-period exposures and adjustment covariates by adding the deterministic summary script (`scripts/make_loop002_descriptives.py:1`), exporting privacy-safe tables (`tables/loop002_teen_covariate_numeric.csv:1`, `tables/loop002_teen_covariate_categorical.csv:1`), and documenting the new content in both the codebook and PAP (`docs/codebook_priority.md:62`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:57`).
- Prototyped H1–H3 regressions plus the anxiety reverse-code audit through `scripts/run_loop002_models.py:1`, storing coefficients in `tables/loop002_model_estimates.csv:1` and the correlation check in `tables/loop002_reverse_code_check.csv:1`; the key exploratory estimates (with sign warnings for mis-oriented Likerts) are now tracked in `analysis/results.csv:2-4`.
- Despite repeated Semantic Scholar 429s, pulled DOI-specific metadata for Moore & Shell (2017) and Hansen (2014), updating the bibliography and evidence map (`lit/bibliography.md:10`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:7`) and citing them directly in the new manuscript outline (`reports/paper.md:1`) along with the current data/methods/results narrative.
- Logged the entire loop for reproducibility (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:23`, `analysis/decision_log.csv:6`), refreshed the experiment state and next actions (`artifacts/state.json:2`), and staged the requested commit message (`artifacts/git_message.txt:1`) so another analyst can pick up seamlessly.

**Next Steps**
- Diagnose and standardize the Likert polarity for abuse, self-love, depression, and related covariates before any confirmatory work (see `artifacts/state.json:5`).
- Extend modeling to ordered logits across all net-worth brackets and add religiosity→anxiety regressions so H3/H4 have defensible primary estimators.
- Freeze/tag the PAP once measurement conventions are settled, then promote hypotheses to confirmatory status and continue fleshing out `reports/paper.md`.
