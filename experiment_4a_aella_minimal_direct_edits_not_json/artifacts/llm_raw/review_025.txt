DECISION: CONTINUE
R1 PASS – Loop 025 logs the seeded manifest check and outputs, and the notebook captures the same steps plus next actions, so another analyst can reproduce the procurement updates (`analysis/decision_log.csv:58`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:213`).
R2 PASS – No new estimands were fit; existing confirmatory rows retain BH-adjusted q-values with explicit SRS justification while the weighting summary keeps the design-effect reruns on hold until proper inputs arrive (`analysis/results.csv:20`, `tables/loop021_h3_weighted_summary.csv:1`).
R3 PASS – The literature/evidence map still lists every DOI supporting the hypotheses, satisfying the citation requirement even without a new search this loop (`lit/evidence_map.csv:2`).
R4 PASS – Newly published artifacts are manifest/Q&A/compliance documents with no respondent cells, so the privacy bar (n≥10) is preserved (`tables/loop021_h3_weight_delivery_status.csv:1`, `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/compliance_appendix_loop025.md:1`).
R5 PASS – Core artifacts (PAP header, state snapshot, reviewer approvals, LOI register, replicate manifest) all reflect the latest backlog and keep the PAP frozen until the next confirmatory freeze (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`, `artifacts/state.json:1`, `docs/reviewer_approvals/religiosity_class_gradients_loop024.md:1`, `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv:1`, `docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:1`).
