DECISION: CONTINUE  
R1 PASS – The loop’s documentation-only work is logged in both `analysis/decision_log.csv:56` and `notebooks/research_notebook.md:203-221`, keeping inputs/outputs, seed policy, and next actions reproducible without new code executions.  
R2 PASS – No new estimands were run, but existing confirmatory rows retain explicit q-values and SRS notes in `analysis/results.csv:20-33`, and the freeze checklist in `docs/religiosity_class_gradients_promotion.md:1-90` keeps the survey-design plan (weights rerun before promotion) explicit, so statistical rigor is preserved.  
R3 PASS – Manuscript updates cite peer-reviewed sources for every claim (e.g., `reports/paper.md:20-33` references Chan & Boliver 2013; Glei et al. 2022), and the curated evidence inventory remains current (`lit/evidence_map.csv:1-20`).  
R4 PASS – Public artifacts stay at n≈14k (see `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv:1-4`) and the privacy policy is reiterated in both the PAP and design-effect plan (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:24-34`, `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:12-35`), so no small-cell disclosures occurred.  
R5 PASS – All required registries remain in place (PAP still frozen at `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-70`), governance artifacts were expanded (`docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:1-70`, `docs/reviewer_approvals/religiosity_class_gradients_loop024.md:1-9`), and state tracking is synced (`artifacts/state.json:1-18`).
