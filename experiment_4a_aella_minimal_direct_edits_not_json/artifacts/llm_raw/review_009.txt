DECISION: CONTINUE
R1 PASS – Loop009 command, outputs, and narrative are logged (`analysis/decision_log.csv:27`; `notebooks/research_notebook.md:75-80`), and the visualization script/table needed for regeneration live in repo (`scripts/loop009_h1_visuals.py:1-206`; `tables/loop009_h1_interaction_grid.csv:1-5`).
R2 PASS – The PAP remains frozen with explicit confirmatory scope/SRS rationale (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-55`), and all confirmatory rows include BH-adjusted q-values plus design notes (`analysis/results.csv:20-25`).
R3 PASS – Manuscript discussion of new visuals cites the peer-reviewed buffering/vulnerability sources and the reference list/evidence map stay current (`reports/paper.md:6-43`; `lit/evidence_map.csv:1-13`).
R4 PASS – Public disclosures rely on aggregated prediction grids with n≈14k per cell and the manuscript documents the n≥10 safeguard for the figure/table pair (`tables/loop009_h1_interaction_grid.csv:1-5`; `reports/paper.md:26-33`).
R5 PASS – Required artifacts (PAP, hypotheses, results, notebook, paper) all reflect Loop009 updates; confirmatory work still post-dates the freeze tag and next actions are tracked (`artifacts/state.json:1-10`).
