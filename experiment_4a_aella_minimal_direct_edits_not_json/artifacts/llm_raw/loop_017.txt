**Key Updates**
- Recorded the ≥$10M PPO estimate plus its low-power diagnostics in the registry so reviewers can see why H3 stays exploratory: `analysis/results.csv:45` now houses the cutpoint effect and cites the 14.8× design effect; `analysis/hypotheses.csv:5` adds the `childhood_class_networth_ge10m` entry; the PAP, sensitivity notes, and manuscript each gained an explicit “hold” decision (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:100-108`, `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:82-85`, `reports/paper.md:32`).  
- Wired the `religiosity_class_gradients` family for fast promotion by logging the moderate/serious contrasts with BH q-values (`analysis/results.csv:46-47`) and registering the family in both the hypothesis file and PAP (`analysis/hypotheses.csv:7`, `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:123-127`). The manuscript now references the ready-to-freeze setup (`reports/paper.md:33`) and the sensitivity log documents the wiring (`analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:86-91`).  
- Assembled a reviewer packet that proves the Loop016 tables obey the n≥10 rule (`docs/loop016_reviewer_packet.md:1-27`) and captured the loop in the decision log, notebook, state snapshot, and commit message (`analysis/decision_log.csv:42`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:132-141`, `artifacts/state.json:3-12`, `artifacts/git_message.txt`).

Tests: not run (documentation-only updates).

Next steps (mirrors `artifacts/state.json:5-8`):  
1. Prototype pooled-wave or reweighted PPO runs to see if the ≥$10M contrast can achieve acceptable power before any confirmatory freeze.  
2. Draft the formal `religiosity_class_gradients` promotion memo (final PAP text, manuscript cites, BH justification) and stress-test whether the serious-practice term should remain in the family.
