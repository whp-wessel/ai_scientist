**Loop 001**
- Built a reproducible priority-variable codebook and linked descriptive exports (`docs/codebook_priority.md:1`, `tables/loop001_numeric_descriptives.csv:1`, `tables/loop001_categorical_counts.csv:1`), capturing scales, coverage, and privacy-safe distributions for every H1–H4 measure.
- Documented the empirical SRS justification directly in the PAP and hypothesis register, citing the header scan result so each hypothesis row now records why `design_used=false` (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:35`, `analysis/hypotheses.csv:2`).
- Expanded the literature base despite Semantic Scholar search throttling by combining one search with DOI-specific pulls; all new sources are logged in both the bibliography and evidence map with their originating JSON artifacts (`lit/bibliography.md:5`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:2`, `lit/queries/loop_001/query_001.json:1`, `lit/queries/loop_001/query_002.json:1`, `lit/queries/loop_001/query_003.json:1`). Rate-limit workarounds are noted in the research notebook (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:15`).
- Logged the sprint and refreshed experiment state so downstream loops know what was done and what remains (`analysis/decision_log.csv:4`, `artifacts/state.json:2`).
- Pre-existing dirty artifacts under `artifacts/repro_report.md:1` and `artifacts/session_info.txt:1` were left untouched.

Next steps:
1. Extend the codebook/descriptives to teen-period exposures and adjustment covariates before freezing the PAP (`artifacts/state.json:5`).
2. Stand up reproducible modeling scripts (OLS/logit) and verify all reverse-coded items behave as expected.
3. Add targeted literature for parental guidance/self-love and class mobility to prepare for confirmatory registration.
