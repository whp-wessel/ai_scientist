DECISION: CONTINUE  
R1 Reproducibility – PASS: Documentation-only loop is logged with inputs/outputs in the decision log, mirrored in the notebook narrative, and state.json lists the updated next actions, so another analyst can reproduce the exact handoff (`analysis/decision_log.csv:50`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:172-180`, `artifacts/state.json:1-18`).  
R2 Statistical Rigor – PASS: The PAP reiterates the SRS justification and records the frozen commands, while the design-effect tracker and power table explain why H3 stays exploratory and how multiplicity is controlled for the H4 contrasts (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:15-19` & `132-137`, `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:22-74`, `tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv:2-21`, `analysis/results.csv:20-50`, `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv:2-5`).  
R3 Literature/Evidence – PASS: The promotion memo cites peer-reviewed DOIs to support the religiosity gradients, those sources are registered in the evidence map, and the manuscript references them in situ (`docs/religiosity_class_gradients_promotion.md:34-38`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:2-20`, `reports/paper.md:7-20`).  
R4 Privacy – PASS: Public tables only expose aggregates with n≥820 (H3) or n≥14k (H4), and the sensitivity notes remind reviewers that no small cells are published (`tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv:2-4`, `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv:2-5`, `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:111-118`).  
R5 Completeness – PASS: PAP remains marked frozen with its tag, the freeze/tag roadmap for the forthcoming H4 family is spelled out, and results plus reviewer packet remain synchronized (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-13` & `132-137`, `analysis/results.csv:20-50`, `docs/loop016_reviewer_packet.md:24-33`).
