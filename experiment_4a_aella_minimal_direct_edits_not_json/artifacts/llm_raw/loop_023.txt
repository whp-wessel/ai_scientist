**Loop 023 Update**
- Built the DG-4827 ingestion pipeline in `scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py:1-200`, which parses the manifest, computes per-file checksums, and will merge PSU IDs/weights/replicates once they exist. Running it produced audit outputs `tables/loop021_h3_weight_delivery_status.csv` (all files `present=False`) and `tables/loop021_h3_weighted_summary.csv` (`status=blocked`), and the manifest + design-effect plan now record the attempted run and remaining blocker (`docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:28-31`, `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:71-75`).
- Added a `--use-weights` override path to `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py:42-130`; when replicate-derived estimates become available (expected in `tables/loop021_h3_weighted_effect.csv`), the script will automatically replace the analytic SE/CI/design-effect rows (`scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py:74-125`) while falling back to the existing SRS figures until then.
- Propagated the DG-4827 status everywhere it’s referenced so reviewers know why the ≥$10M contrast still relies on SRS: PAP entry `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:40-46`, manuscript Next Steps `reports/paper.md:33-40`, and notebook narrative `notebooks/research_notebook.md:193-205`. State/trace artifacts were updated as well (`analysis/decision_log.csv:54`, `artifacts/state.json:9-15`).

Tests:  
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py --manifest docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md` (completes; reports missing `psu`, `weights`, `brr`).  
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py` (baseline SRS summary regenerated to ensure no regressions).

Next steps:
1. Secure the DG-4827 delivery + checksum sheet, rerun `loop021` to populate `outputs/loop021_h3_weighted_panel.parquet`, then execute `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py --use-weights` to refresh `tables/loop016_h3_power_summary.csv`.
2. Continue prepping the `religiosity_class_gradients` freeze (rerun `loop020` stress tests, finalize `tables/loop016_h4_confirmatory.csv`, and stage the PAP/tag work).

Note: `git status` still lists unrelated edits under `../experiment_4b_aella_extensive_direct_edits_not_json/`; left untouched per instructions.
