DECISION: CONTINUE  
R1 PASS – `analysis/decision_log.csv:67` and `notebooks/research_notebook.md:252` log the Loop 029 commands with `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016`, while `artifacts/state.json` reflects the updated loop counter and next actions.  
R2 PASS – The PAP remains frozen for H1 (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-54`), confirmatory rows carry BH-adjusted q-values and SRS justification (`analysis/results.csv:20-21`), and the design-effect tracker documents the ongoing weight-replication audit (`docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:60-150`).  
R3 PASS – Literature assets enumerate DOI-linked sources (`lit/evidence_map.csv`), and the manuscript cites those works with DOIs when making substantive claims (`reports/paper.md:1-54`).  
R4 PASS – Public registries such as `tables/loop021_h3_weight_delivery_status.csv` and `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/verification_register.csv:2` report only aggregate counts (≥22) and avoid any n<10 disclosures.  
R5 PASS – Required artifacts (PAP, hypotheses, results, manuscript, state) are present and updated, and new LOIs (`docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/LOI_Spain_2025-11-12.md`, `LOI_Norway_2025-11-12.md`) plus the LOI register keep the H3 mitigation storyline current.

Notes: Continue monitoring DG‑4827 delivery and execute the planned H4 freeze once approvals arrive.
