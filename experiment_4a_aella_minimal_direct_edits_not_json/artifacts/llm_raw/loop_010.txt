**Summary**
- Added a reproducible partial proportional-odds workflow for H3 (`scripts/loop010_h3_partial_models.py:1`) that stacks the nine cumulative net-worth logits, frees the childhood-class slopes, and was executed with `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop010_h3_partial_models.py` to refresh all outputs.
- Saved coefficient, threshold-effect, and fit diagnostics so others can benchmark the PPO spec (`tables/loop010_h3_partial_params.csv:1`, `tables/loop010_h3_threshold_effects.csv:1`, `tables/loop010_h3_partial_fit.csv:1`); key insight is that class advantages disappear near the ≥$100k bracket but reappear for ≥$10M.
- Logged two representative threshold effects in the results registry to document how the PPO reshapes H3 inference (`analysis/results.csv:28-29`) and recorded the loop in the decision log (`analysis/decision_log.csv:29`).
- Narrated the sprint and manuscript implications (partial-odds summary + new backlog) in the research notebook (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:82`) and paper (`reports/paper.md:28`), keeping the documentation aligned with the new modeling path.
- Updated the experiment state so the next loop inherits the refreshed counter and backlog (`artifacts/state.json:3-12`) and staged the commit message for the runner (`artifacts/git_message.txt:1`).

**Next Steps**
1. Benchmark PPO against an unordered multinomial net-worth model and decide which specification should anchor H3 in the PAP/manuscript.
2. Prototype the next robustness wave (e.g., H1 bootstrap CIs and alternative anxiety codings) to pave the way for the sensitivity phase.
3. Run additional Semantic Scholar queries focused on H2/H3 constructs to expand the literature/measurement dossier before any PAP expansion.
