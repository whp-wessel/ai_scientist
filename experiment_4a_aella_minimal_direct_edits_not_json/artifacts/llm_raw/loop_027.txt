**Summary**
- Daily DG-4827 check re-ran `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py --manifest docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md`; the manifest and design-effect plan now carry a Loop 027 entry showing the run remained blocked because the BRR/PSU/weight files are still undelivered (`docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:50`, `docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:76`).
- Added the 2025‑11‑11 vendor exchanges (Empiria PSU boundary question and JadeVista storage waiver) and tied the RFP spec to the LOI roster so bidders know the accepted PSU naming scheme (`docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/qna_loop021.md:29`, `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/rfp_2025-11-09.md:14`).
- Logged China and South Korea as fully countersigned with DocuSign IDs plus addenda covering the cross-border vault and BRR annexes, so all eight countries now show firm commitments (`docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/loi_register.csv:5`,`:9`; `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/LOI_China_2025-11-09.md:26`; `docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/LOI_SouthKorea_2025-11-09.md:26`).
- Repro artifacts updated: decision log, notebook narrative, state snapshot, and commit message all describe Loop 027 so the audit trail stays current (`analysis/decision_log.csv:62`; `notebooks/research_notebook.md:234`; `artifacts/state.json:9`; `artifacts/git_message.txt:1`).

**Testing**
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop021_h3_weighted_checks.py --manifest docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md` (still blocked; missing brr/psu/weights inputs).

**Next Steps**
1. Paste the DG-4827 checksum email into `docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/dg-4827_checksums_2025-11-16.txt`, rerun the ingestion script, and feed the result into `scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py --use-weights` as soon as Data Governance drops the bundle.
2. After Dr. Mendez approves the religiosity promotion, rerun `scripts/loop020_h4_stress_tests.py` → `scripts/loop016_h4_confirmatory_tables.py`, flip the H4 rows to `confirmatory=TRUE`, rewrite the PAP header with tag `pap_freeze_h4_loop024`, and log the new git tag.
3. Keep appending every high-wealth RFP Q&A exchange and LOI signature (with DocuSign IDs) through the 2025‑11‑15 Q&A deadline so procurement reviewers can trace the full mitigation trail.
