DECISION: CONTINUE
R1 PASS - Loop‑23 work is fully logged with commands/seeds (`analysis/decision_log.csv:54`), and the executed scripts/tests are spelled out in the run log so another analyst can rerun them (`artifacts/last_model_raw.txt:2` and `artifacts/last_model_raw.txt:7`).  
R2 PASS - Confirmatory H1 estimates still include estimates/SEs/CIs/q-values (`analysis/results.csv:20` and `analysis/results.csv:21`), the PAP documents why SRS remains in force plus how the blocked weighting feed will be used once delivered (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:45`), and the refreshed power script now exposes a `--use-weights` override (`scripts/loop016_h3_power_check.py:45`).  
R3 PASS - Manuscript claims cite peer-reviewed sources (e.g., Zhang/Moore/Zhao/Assari citations in `reports/paper.md:10`), and the DOI-linked evidence map continues to track every source (`lit/evidence_map.csv:2`).  
R4 PASS - Privacy policy is reiterated (public outputs keep n≥135 per `reports/paper.md:19`), and the new weight-delivery table only logs file presence with no respondent counts (`tables/loop021_h3_weight_delivery_status.csv:2`).  
R5 PASS - Required artifacts remain current: the PAP header stays frozen/hashed (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`), the research notebook narrates the Loop‑23 DG‑4827 blocker and follow-ups (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:193`), and the state file lists the actionable backlog (`artifacts/state.json:11`).
