**Loop 018 Outputs**
- Added `scripts/loop018_h3_wavepooling.py#L1-L210` plus the derived table `tables/loop018_h3_wavepooling_summary.csv`, which reuse the PPO stack to simulate wave-pooling and ≥$10M oversamples. Baseline effective n stays ≈978 with cluster power 0.12; two pooled waves drive effective n to 1,955 yet only raise cluster power to 0.20; even three pooled waves (effective n=2,932) stall at power 0.27, and a 2× ≥$10M oversample remains at 0.12 because clusters are unchanged. These numbers formalize why the ≥$10M contrast remains exploratory.
- Wove the scenario findings into the record: `reports/paper.md:12-22` now cites `tables/loop018_h3_wavepooling_summary.csv` when explaining why H3 cannot freeze; `notebooks/research_notebook.md:143-150` narrates the loop and captures the follow-up plan; `analysis/decision_log.csv:44` logs the commands/inputs/outputs; `artifacts/state.json:1-12` bumps the loop counter to 18 and updates the backlog to focus on the religiosity memo, serious-practice stress tests, and design-effect mitigation planning. Dropped the checkpoint request in `artifacts/git_message.txt`.
- Public artifacts stay privacy-safe: the new table aggregates ≥820 respondents per row, and no personal-level data left the repo.

**Verification**
- Re-run `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop018_h3_wavepooling.py` to regenerate the scenario table before committing/pushing.

**Next Steps**
1. Draft the `religiosity_class_gradients` promotion memo (PAP text + manuscript cites + BH rationale).
2. Stress-test the serious-practice × classchild interaction (e.g., shrinkage priors or alternate anxiety codings) to decide if it remains confirmatory.
3. Explore realistic ways to shrink the H3 design effect (additional countries, new waves, or alternative clustering metadata), since naïve pooling still leaves cluster power <0.3.
