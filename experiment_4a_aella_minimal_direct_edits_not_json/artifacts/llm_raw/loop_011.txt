**Loop 011 Deliverables**
- Benchmarked H3 specs by adding `scripts/loop011_h3_multinomial_benchmark.py:35-165`, which fits the multinomial logit, exports params/marginals/fit stats, and auto-builds `tables/loop011_h3_model_comparison.csv:1`. Results rows (`analysis/results.csv:28-30`) now document both the PPO cutpoints and the multinomial marginal effect (dy/dx ≈0.001, p=0.64), and the PAP/manuscript were updated to justify keeping the partial proportional-odds estimator (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:40-44`, `reports/paper.md:20,32`).
- Captured the upcoming robustness queue in writing: `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:20-41` now spells out the 500-replicate H1 bootstrap plan plus the alternative anxiety codings, and the manuscript’s Next Steps mirror that scope (`reports/paper.md:35-38`). State tracking was refreshed accordingly (`artifacts/state.json:3-9`).
- Expanded the H2–H3 literature set via new Semantic Scholar pulls (`lit/queries/loop_011/query_001.json`, `query_004.json`), adding Jiang et al. (2024) and Zimmer et al. (2016) to both the bibliography and evidence map (`lit/bibliography.md:17-18`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:14-15`) to support the self-love and net-worth narratives.
- Logged everything for reproducibility: notebook entry `notebooks/research_notebook.md:93-97`, decision log row `analysis/decision_log.csv:31`, new public tables (`tables/loop011_h3_multinomial_params.csv:1`, `tables/loop011_h3_multinomial_marginals.csv:1`, `tables/loop011_h3_multinomial_fit.csv:1`), and the commit message stub in `artifacts/git_message.txt`.

**Tests**
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop011_h3_multinomial_benchmark.py`

**Next Steps**
1. Implement `scripts/loop012_h1_bootstrap.py` to generate the planned 500 bootstrap draws and summarize them under `tables/loop012_h1_bootstrap_*`.
2. Build `scripts/loop012_h4_alt_outcomes.py` to create the 3-bin ordinal and high-anxiety outcomes, export diagnostics, and document them in the sensitivity notes.
3. Turn the PPO vs multinomial comparison into publishable visuals/tables so H3 can advance toward PAP promotion once robustness work lands.
