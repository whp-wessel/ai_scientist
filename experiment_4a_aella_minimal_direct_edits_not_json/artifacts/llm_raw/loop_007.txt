**Loop 007 Summary**
- Non-negotiable alert cleared: the PAP header now records the literal freeze hash (`status: frozen (commit 90f349d080541060fd90ba5a6310a87eef925c47)`), keeping the document aligned with tag `pap_freeze_loop006` (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1`).
- Implemented `scripts/loop007_h1_sensitivity.py:1` to refit the H1 guidance and gender interactions with HC3 SEs and an expanded covariate set; outputs land in `tables/loop007_h1_sensitivity.csv:1` and are narrated in the new `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:1`.
- Logged both perturbations as confirmatory sensitivity rows so BH-adjusted q-values now accompany the HC3 specs (`analysis/results.csv:22` and `analysis/results.csv:23`) and the expanded-control specs (`analysis/results.csv:24` and `analysis/results.csv:25`).
- Section 3 of the manuscript now references these robustness checks to document their implications for the confirmatory story (`reports/paper.md:24`).
- Repro artifacts are current: the notebook captures Loop 007 actions (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:56`–`61`), the state snapshot reflects loop counter + refreshed next actions (`artifacts/state.json:3`–`8`), and the decision log picked up separate entries for the sensitivity run and the literature pull (`analysis/decision_log.csv:16`–`17`). Commit message placeholder updated for the next checkpoint (`artifacts/git_message.txt:1`).
- Advanced H2 readiness work by storing a new Semantic Scholar query (`lit/queries/loop_007/query_001.json`), adding Fermani (2019) and Walęcka‑Matyja (2019) to the bibliography (`lit/bibliography.md:11`–`12`) and evidence map (`lit/evidence_map.csv:8`–`9`), and documenting the retry after an initial 429 throttle.

**Tests**
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop007_h1_sensitivity.py`
- `python scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py search --query "parental guidance self love adulthood" --limit 5 --output lit/queries/loop_007/query_001.json` (second attempt succeeded after the rate-limit response)

**Next Steps**
1. Finish the H2–H4 promotion review by pairing today’s new sources with diagnostics (e.g., proportional-odds tests, self-love measurement checks) before revising the PAP.
2. Build the manuscript-ready interaction figure/table for H1 while enforcing the n≥10 publication rule.
3. Plan the next robustness wave (bootstraps or alternative outcomes) so the project can transition into the sensitivity phase once H2–H4 decisions are locked.
