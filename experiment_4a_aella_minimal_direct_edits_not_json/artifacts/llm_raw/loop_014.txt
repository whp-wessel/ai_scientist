**Summary**
- Implemented the country-cluster PPO bootstrap pipeline (`scripts/loop014_h3_cluster_bootstrap.py:1`) and published the replicate distributions (`tables/loop014_h3_bootstrap_summary.csv:1`). The ≥$100k/≥$1MM effects now live in `analysis/results.csv:35-36`, are interpreted in the sensitivity log (`analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:63`), and are cited in the manuscript’s exploratory section (`reports/paper.md:32`).
- Added religiosity×class/gender diagnostics through `scripts/loop014_h4_interactions.py:1`, producing `tables/loop014_h4_interactions.csv:1`. Four new interaction estimates were appended to `analysis/results.csv:37-40`, summarized in the sensitivity notes (`analysis/sensitivity_notes.md:70`), discussed in the manuscript (`reports/paper.md:33`), and backed by the post-2018 Davis et al. (2021) citation (`lit/bibliography.md:22`, `lit/evidence_map.csv:19`).
- Logged the loop and refreshed documentation/state so the work is reproducible: decision log entry (`analysis/decision_log.csv:36`), notebook narrative plus next steps (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:112`), and updated project state snapshot (`artifacts/state.json:3`).

**Tests**
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop014_h3_cluster_bootstrap.py --n-reps 300`
- `PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop014_h4_interactions.py`

**Next Steps**
1. Decide whether to redefine the H3 confirmatory contrasts (e.g., focus on ≥$10M) before updating the PAP with the bootstrap evidence.
2. Build manuscript-ready visuals for the H4 class interaction and probe robustness with richer covariate sets ahead of a confirmatory estimand.
3. Stage privacy-compliant public tables bundling the H3 bootstrap summaries and H4 interaction coefficients for reviewer review.
