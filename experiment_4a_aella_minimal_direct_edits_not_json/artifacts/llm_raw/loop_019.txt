**Summary**
- Created `docs/religiosity_class_gradients_promotion.md:1-43`, a formal memo that captures the H4 estimand, evidence snapshot, BH q-values, literature support, stress-test checklist, and reproducibility/seed policy so reviewers have a single artifact to evaluate the confirmatory promotion.
- Synced core documentation by pointing the PAP to the memo and embedding the updated q-values and remaining stress tests (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:110-129`) while the manuscript now cites the memo in both the Data & Methods bullets and the H4 narrative so the confirmatory workflow stays coherent (`reports/paper.md:23` and `reports/paper.md:35`).
- Logged the loop by adding the Loop 019 notebook entry plus next steps (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:152-160`), appending the action to `analysis/decision_log.csv:45`, refreshing the state snapshot with the new loop counter and backlog (`artifacts/state.json:9-14`), and drafting the checkpoint message in `artifacts/git_message.txt:1`.

**Testing**
- Not run; documentation-only changes.

**Next Steps**
1. Run the serious-practice stress tests (ridge/shrinkage fits and alternate anxiety codings) to decide whether that interaction should stay in the confirmatory family.
2. Extend the H4 confirmatory shell to include the ordinal anxiety outcome so binary/ordinal codings can be audited in tandem.
3. Turn the H3 design-effect scenarios into a concrete data acquisition plan (e.g., required new countries/respondents) since naive wave pooling still leaves power <0.3.
