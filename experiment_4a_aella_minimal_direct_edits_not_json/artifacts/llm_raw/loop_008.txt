**Loop 008 Update**
- Added the adult “at war with yourself” item to the shared Likert spec so every script produces aligned/z columns for the new self-love diagnostics (`scripts/likert_utils.py:34-90`), then built a dedicated pipeline for H2–H4 diagnostics (`scripts/loop008_h2h3h4_diagnostics.py:1-236`). The run (`PYTHONHASHSEED=20251016 python scripts/loop008_h2h3h4_diagnostics.py`) generated the new public tables under `tables/loop008_*`.
- H2 measurement check: the self-love + inverted self-war composite shows Cronbach’s α=0.42 with item correlation r=0.27 and sizeable associations with depression/anxiety (r=0.48/0.37) plus guidance (r=0.23), so we logged the overlap-before-promotion story in both the tables (`tables/loop008_h2_measurement.csv:1-6`) and manuscript (`reports/paper.md:12-29`).
- H3 proportional-odds stress test: stacked logits across the nine wealth cutpoints (threshold coefficients in `tables/loop008_h3_po_thresholds.csv`) reveal education and gender coefficients that swing by ≥0.65 log-odds, which we summarized in `tables/loop008_h3_po_summary.csv:1-6` and cited in the paper/notebook to flag the need for a partial-PO or multinomial alternative.
- H4 ordinal-vs-categorical religiosity: the new tables (`tables/loop008_h4_religiosity_models.csv`, `tables/loop008_h4_religiosity_tests.csv:1-2`) and corresponding rows in `analysis/results.csv:26-27` show that the “very serious practice” dummy carries -0.41 log-odds for high anxiety while the LR test still tolerates an ordinal treatment; this is now narratively captured in `reports/paper.md:27-30`.
- Literature + reproducibility: archived the loop008 Semantic Scholar pull (one 429 retry) under `lit/queries/loop_008/query_001.json`, added Tolonen (2024) and Alifah & Lubis (2024) to both `lit/bibliography.md:15-16` and `lit/evidence_map.csv:12-13`, and back-filled the missing loop entries in `analysis/decision_log.csv:19-24` / `notebooks/research_notebook.md:67-73`. State, manuscript, and commit message are updated (`artifacts/state.json:1-12`, `reports/paper.md:12-35`, `artifacts/git_message.txt:1`).  
  _(Note: `git status` also lists sibling repo files under `../experiment_4b_*`; left untouched.)_

**Next actions**
1. Build the manuscript-ready H1 visuals/public tables the state file now calls for (interaction plots + disclosure-safe tables in `tables/loop009_*`).
2. Prototype a partial proportional-odds or multinomial net-worth model (and document how it resolves the PO violations) before attempting any H3 promotion; in parallel, outline the next robustness wave (bootstrap CIs or alternative anxiety codings) so we can enter the sensitivity phase smoothly.
