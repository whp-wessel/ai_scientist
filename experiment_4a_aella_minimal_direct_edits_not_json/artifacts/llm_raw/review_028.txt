DECISION: CONTINUE
R1 PASS – Loop 028 is fully logged with commands/seeds (`analysis/decision_log.csv:64`), mirrored in the notebook narrative (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:243-248`), and the state file lists refreshed next actions (`artifacts/state.json:1-18`); the manifest documents the rerun timestamp (`docs/h3_replicate_weights_manifest/manifest_loop021.md:55-58`).
R2 PASS – No new estimands were tested; the only computation reran the blocked weight-ingestion script, and resulting tables just confirm missing files (`tables/loop021_h3_weight_delivery_status.csv:1-5`, `tables/loop021_h3_weighted_summary.csv:1-2`) while the design-effect plan notes the pending weighted reruns (`docs/h3_design_effect_plan.md:100-124`).
R3 PASS – No manuscript claims changed this loop, and the existing evidence map remains intact for all hypotheses (`lit/evidence_map.csv:1-18`).
R4 PASS – Public artifacts added this loop (weight status tables, Q&A log, LOI docs) contain only operational metadata with no microdata or n<10 cells (`tables/loop021_h3_weight_delivery_status.csv:1-5`, `docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/qna_loop021.md:37-58`), and privacy safeguards stay codified in the PAP (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:26-33`).
R5 PASS – Required artifacts continue to exist and align: PAP remains frozen for H1 (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:1-45`), hypothesis registry unchanged (`analysis/hypotheses.csv:1-7`), the Italy LOI plus register entry capture the new partner (`docs/h3_country_expansion_materials/LOI_Italy_2025-11-12.md:1-32`, `loi_register.csv:10`), and the verification register scaffold is in place (`docs/h3_high_wealth_refresh/verification_register.csv:1`).
