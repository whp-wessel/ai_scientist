This document operationalises backlog item **T-011** by detailing the deterministic workflow for (a) applying Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) false-discovery-rate adjustments and (b) executing the frozen robustness checks for confirmatory hypotheses. All steps assume the PAP (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`) remains frozen as of 2025-11-04T10:06Z and that confirmatory estimates have been regenerated via the registered command.\n\n## Preconditions\n- Clean dataset: `data/clean/childhoodbalancedpublic_with_csa_indicator.csv`\n- Confirmatory results populated: `analysis/results.csv` (seed column populated, timestamped)\n- Registry: `analysis/hypotheses.csv` with `status ∈ {in_PAP, tested}
