DECISION: CONTINUE

R1 Reproducibility: WARN — Seeds/env logged (`artifacts/seed.txt`, `artifacts/session_info.txt`), actions scripted and captured in `analysis/decision_log.csv`; however, `artifacts/git_message.txt` is missing despite logs claiming it.
R2 Statistical Rigor: PASS — SRS explicitly justified in `analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md` and in registries; results in `analysis/results.csv` include estimates, SEs, CIs, p-values; no confirmatory families yet, so no FDR required.
R3 Literature/Evidence: PASS — Semantic Scholar queries saved under `lit/queries/`, evidence map present (`lit/evidence_map.csv`), and citations with DOIs appear in `reports/paper.md`.
R4 Privacy: PASS — No public tables in `tables/`; analysis outputs stay in `analysis/` and comply with the n<10 suppression policy if/when public tables are produced.
R5 Completeness: PASS — Core artifacts present (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md` status: draft, `analysis/hypotheses.csv`, `analysis/results.csv`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md`, `reports/paper.md`, `lit/*`); no confirmatory results recorded pre-freeze.

Notes: Write `artifacts/git_message.txt` to request a checkpoint commit. Next loop should freeze/tag the PAP and pre-specify H3 ordered-logit sensitivity and key interactions.

Next review model: gpt-5-codex | reason: Best at pinpointing file-level gaps (e.g., commit protocol) and PAP freeze readiness.
