**Highlights**
- Added a deterministic runner for the frozen OLS specs (`analysis/scripts/run_confirmatory_ols.py:1`) and re-ran H1–H4; the confirmatory estimates are now recorded in both registries (`analysis/results.csv:6-9`, `analysis/hypotheses.csv:2-5`) and published as a privacy-safe table (`tables/loop005_confirmatory_ols.csv:2-5`, all n≥14,426 so no suppression needed). Families still contain a single confirmatory test, so FDR control remains unnecessary.
- Upgraded the ordered-logit sensitivity script to emit Loop 5 outputs with CIs and method metadata (`analysis/scripts/ordered_logit_h3.py:1-80`); the sensitivity coefficient is logged in `analysis/results.csv:10` and released publicly via `tables/loop005_h3_ordered_logit.csv:2` (n=14,428).
- Compliance + documentation refresh: the PAP explicitly cites the freeze commit/tag and reiterates the SRS justification after re-checking the Balanced Data release (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:3-15`), the manuscript now summarizes confirmatory findings with DOI-backed claims (`reports/paper.md:3-18`), and the run was logged across the decision log, research notebook, and state tracker (`analysis/decision_log.csv:30`, `notebooks/research_notebook.md:41-46`, `artifacts/state.json:2-34`). A commit request and message/tag instructions are in place (`artifacts/git_message.txt:1`; git tag `pap_freeze_loop004` now points to commit `565989e`).

**Testing**
- `python analysis/scripts/run_confirmatory_ols.py`
- `python analysis/scripts/ordered_logit_h3.py`

**Next Steps**
1. Run the pre-specified gender-interaction and quadratic sensitivity models for H1–H4, logging outputs under `analysis/results/` and noting any effect shifts.
2. Execute leverage (Cook’s D) and VIF diagnostics per the PAP, summarizing conclusions in `analysis/sensitivity_notes.md`.
3. Begin figure/table drafting for the manuscript, expanding literature context as needed while keeping public tables under the n<10 rule.

Next science model: gpt-5-codex | reason: Upcoming sensitivity scripts/diagnostics are code-heavy and benefit from Codex’s tooling precision.
