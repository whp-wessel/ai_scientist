PAP freeze, confirmatory families, and next steps are in place.

- PAP frozen: Set to frozen and recorded tag plan.
  - analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:3 now reads “status: frozen (commit <hash>)”.
  - analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:5 records “Freeze tag: pap_freeze_loop004 (to be created on commit)”.
  - Added “Confirmatory Families and Primary Estimands” with exact formulas, interactions/nonlinearity as sensitivities, and deterministic commands.

- Confirmatory registry: Marked primary tests per family as confirmatory.
  - analysis/hypotheses.csv:2–5 set `confirmatory=TRUE` for H1–H4 with concise model notes.

- H3 sensitivity script: Implemented ordered logit for pre-specified robustness.
  - analysis/scripts/ordered_logit_h3.py:22 points to derived data; fits OrderedModel logit and writes results to analysis/results/loop004_h3_ordered_logit.csv.

- Logs and notebook updated:
  - analysis/decision_log.csv: appended pap_freeze entry with freeze tag and scripts.
  - notebooks/research_notebook.md: Loop 4 entry describes freeze, sensitivities, and tag plan.

- State and commit:
  - artifacts/state.json: phase moved to analysis, loop_counter=4, next actions updated, queued gpt-5-codex.
  - artifacts/git_message.txt: request to commit + tag pap_freeze_loop004.

Key file refs
- analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:3,5,46 (frozen header and confirmatory families)
- analysis/hypotheses.csv:2 (H1 confirmatory), 3 (H2), 4 (H3), 5 (H4)
- analysis/scripts/ordered_logit_h3.py:22 (paths), 35 (fit), 23 (output path)

- artifacts/git_message.txt:1 (commit message for PAP freeze + tag)

What’s next (queued in state)
- Run confirmatory OLS for H1–H4 and record results (confirmatory=true).
- Run H3 ordered-logit sensitivity and compare with OLS.
- Compute FDR only if >1 confirmatory test per family (currently N/A).
- Prepare public tables under tables/ with n<10 suppression.
- Continue design provenance check; keep SRS justification if none emerges.

Request
- Please perform the commit and create the tag: pap_freeze_loop004. After the push, we’ll update the PAP header with the tag’s commit hash.

Next science model: gpt-5-codex | reason: Execute confirmatory OLS and ordered-logit sensitivity with precise, scripted outputs.
