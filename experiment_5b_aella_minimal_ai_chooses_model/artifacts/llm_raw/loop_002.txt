**Loop 002**
- Implemented a reproducible Likert workflow: `analysis/scripts/derive_likert_scales.py:1` now reads the survey, adds respondent IDs, and emits centered/standardized variants for all H1–H4 variables plus the covariate stack in `analysis/derived/loop002_likert_scales.csv` so downstream scripts share the same inputs.
- Clarified the PAP and hypothesis registry around the new scales and baseline controls, documenting the HC3 OLS plan and outstanding pre-freeze items (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:26`, `analysis/hypotheses.csv:2`).
- Ran exploratory OLS prototypes for H1/H2 via `analysis/scripts/prototype_h1_h2_regressions.py:1`; the resulting effect sizes and uncertainty are logged in `analysis/results.csv:2` with SRS justifications intact, and full model diagnostics live at `analysis/results/loop002_h1_h2_regressions.csv`.
- Synchronized narrative artifacts: the research notebook captures this loop’s work (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:19`), while the manuscript now explains the harmonized scales, prototype findings, and supporting literature (`reports/paper.md:12`).
- Advanced tracking/state: appended the decision log, flipped the project to PAP phase with refreshed next actions (`artifacts/state.json:2`), and wrote the checkpoint request at `artifacts/git_message.txt:1`; no public tables were produced so privacy constraints remain satisfied.

- **Tests:** `python analysis/scripts/derive_likert_scales.py`; `python analysis/scripts/prototype_h1_h2_regressions.py`
- **Next steps:** 1) Expand the harmonized-scale/regression workflow to H3/H4 (classcurrent outcome, depression pairing). 2) Flesh out PAP diagnostics + confirmatory family definitions so the plan can be frozen/tagged. 3) Hunt for survey design documentation or formalize the final SRS rationale ahead of public reporting.

Next science model: gpt-5 | reason: Need higher-level reasoning to finish PAP drafting and confirmatory planning before the next analytical sprint.
