**Loop 001**
- Generated reproducible summaries for all H1–H4 predictors/outcomes via `analysis/scripts/profile_key_variables.py`, confirming ≥14.4k responses, ≤17 missing cases, and symmetric −3…+3 Likert coding; outputs live in `analysis/profiling/loop001_key_vars_summary.csv:2-9`, with the privacy rationale captured in `notebooks/research_notebook.md:11-17`.
- Folded these observations back into the PAP so future recodes/models explicitly cite the new profiling artifacts and coverage (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md:31-34`).
- Logged the work in `analysis/decision_log.csv:7` and advanced the project journal entry (`notebooks/research_notebook.md:11-17`) for auditability.
- Ran the required Semantic Scholar searches (queries 001–006) and appended four new citable sources to both the evidence map and bibliography to cover parental guidance, emotional neglect, ACEs↔internet use, and early digital literacy (`lit/evidence_map.csv:3-6`, `lit/bibliography.bib:11-48`).
- Updated run-state metadata so downstream loops know the remaining priorities and that loop_counter advanced (`artifacts/state.json:2-33`) and staged the requested commit message (`artifacts/git_message.txt:1`) for the runner.

Tests: not run (not requested).

Next steps:
1. Implement the −3..3 → centered/standardized recode script plus covariate assembly so each hypothesis has a ready-to-run design matrix.
2. Expand the PAP with concrete model formulas (link functions, controls) in preparation for freezing.
3. Stand up exploratory regressions for H1/H2 to vet effect sizes, diagnostics, and any need for non-linear terms before marking analyses confirmatory.

Next science model: gpt-5-codex | reason: Upcoming recoding and modeling tasks remain code/data-heavy and benefit from Codex’s tooling skills.
