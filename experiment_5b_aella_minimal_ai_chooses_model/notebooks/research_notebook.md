## 2025-11-08 — Bootstrap (Loop 0)
- Surveyed repository: dataset present but no codebook/design files. Logged TODOs under `docs/TODO.md`.
- Inspected first rows of `childhoodbalancedpublic_original.csv`; ~718 columns mixing demographics, childhood context, and adult wellbeing indicators.
- Created baseline artifacts (`analysis/pre_analysis_plan.md`, `analysis/hypotheses.csv`, `analysis/results.csv`) and articulated four thematic hypotheses.
- Implemented `scripts/semantic_scholar_cli.py` to comply with the required Semantic Scholar workflow; captured first query output at `lit/queries/loop_000/query_001.json`.
- Seeded literature tracking (see `lit/bibliography.bib` + `lit/evidence_map.csv`) and recorded bootstrap decisions in `analysis/decision_log.csv`.
- Next loop priorities: profile missingness & distributions for key variables, draft recode scripts, and expand literature on childhood adversity ↔ adult wellbeing.
