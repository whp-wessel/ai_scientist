      "abstract": "Childhood obesity is a complex public health issue with significant implications for long-term health outcomes and healthcare costs. This study investigates the determinants of childhood obesity, focusing on socioeconomic and environmental factors. Data were collected from 310 children and their families using a structured questionnaire from Jodhpur City. Socioeconomic variables included parental education level and household income, while environmental factors encompassed access to healthy food options and safe outdoor spaces for physical activity. Multiple regression analysis examined the relationship between these factors and childhood obesity, controlling for potential confounders. Results indicate that parental education level and household income were inversely associated with childhood obesity, suggesting that higher socioeconomic status may protect against obesity risk. Additionally, access to healthy food options in the neighborhood emerged as a significant predictor of childhood obesity, highlighting the importance of environmental factors in shaping dietary behaviors. These findings underscore the need for multifaceted interventions targeting socioeconomic disparities and ecological barriers to promote healthy weight among children. Effective strategies may include improving access to nutritious foods and creating supportive environments for community physical activity. Addressing the determinants of childhood obesity is crucial for mitigating its adverse health effects and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.\nKEYWORDS: Childhood Obesity, Public Health, Healthy Lifestyle, Socioeconomic Factors, Physical Activity"

      "abstract": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) refers to a heterogeneous group of rheumatic conditions in children. Novel drugs have greatly improved disease outcomes; however, outcomes are impacted by limited awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and adequate treatment, and by differences in access across health systems. As a result, patients with JIA continue to be at risk for short- and long-term morbidity, as well as impacts on virtually all aspects of life of the child and family. Literature on the socioeconomic burden of JIA is largely focused on healthcare costs, and the impact of JIA on patients, families, and communities is not well understood. High quality evidence on the impact of JIA is needed to ensure that patients are receiving necessary support, timely diagnostics, and adequate treatment, and to inform decision making and resource allocation. This commentary introduces the European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases: Producing an Arthritis Value Framework with Economic Evidence: Paving the Way for Rare Childhood Diseases (PAVE) project, which will co-develop a patient-informed value framework to measure the impact of JIA on individuals and on society. With a patient-centered approach, fundamental to PAVE is the involvement of three patient advocacy organizations from Canada, Israel, and Europe, as active research partners co-designing all project phases and ensuring robust patient and family engagement. The framework will build on the findings of projects from six countries: Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Israel, and Belgium, exploring costs, outcomes (health, well-being), and unmet needs (uveitis, mental health, equity). This unique international collaboration will combine evidence on costs (from family to societal), outcomes (clinical, patient and family outcomes), and unmet needs, to co-design and build a framework with patients and families to capture the full impact of JIA. The framework will support the development of high-quality evidence, encompassing economic and clinical considerations, unmet needs, and patient perspectives, to inform equitable resource allocation, health system planning, and quality of care better aligned with the needs of children with JIA, their families, and communities. Knowledge gained from this novel approach may pave the way forward to be applied more broadly to other rare childhood diseases."

      "abstract": "Recent literature has established a strong foundation examining the associations between socioeconomic/demographic characteristics and outcomes for congenital heart disease. These associations are found beginning in fetal life and influence rates of prenatal detection, access to timely and appropriate delivery room and neonatal interventions, and surgical and other early childhood outcomes. This review takes a broad look at the existing literature and identifies gaps in the current body of research, particularly as it pertains to disparities in the prenatal detection of congenital heart disease within the United States. It also proposes further research and interventions to address these health disparities."
