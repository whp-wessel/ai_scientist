      "abstract": "This study examines the serial mediating effects of major satisfaction and career adaptability in the relationship between parental career support and occupational engagement among 240 college students. This research employs questionnaire data and serial mediation model analyses via SPSS Macro models 4 and 6 to explore the potential pathways through which parental career support may influence students' occupational engagement. The findings reveal that both major satisfaction and career adaptability serve as significant partial mediators individually (Model 4) and in tandem (Model 6) in the relationship between parental career support and occupational engagement. Furthermore, bootstrapping analysis highlights the indirect effects, showcasing the greater influence of major satisfaction when compared to career adaptability. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating parental career support, major satisfaction, and career adaptability into career education and guidance programs to enhance college students' occupational engagement."

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Cumulative childhood trauma (CCT) increases the risk of relationship difficulties in adulthood. Couples welcoming a new child are particularly prone to relationship distress, and CCT survivors may be especially vulnerable during this period. This study examined the association between CCT and relationship satisfaction and tested the role of parental alliance in this association. A random sample of 1136 different\u2010gender parental couples completed online self\u2010report questionnaires. Path analyses guided by the Actor\u2013Partner Interdependence Model revealed that parents' CCT was associated with their own lower relationship satisfaction through their own and their partner's parental alliance in both mothers and fathers. Results also revealed dyadic associations between one parent's CCT and their partner's relationship satisfaction through their own and their partner's parental alliance. These findings support the relevance of couple interventions focusing on the parental alliance to improve relational well\u2010being in parental couples where one or both partners have experienced CCT."

      "abstract": "\n\nIntroduction: Adolescence is a period of life in which a person grows and matures. It is a period of turbulent changes and a transition from childhood to adulthood. The changes that occur in a young person on a somatic, mental and psychological level affect the person\u2019s anorexic or bulimic behavior.\n\nObjective: To determine the relationship between the symptoms of eating disorders, anxiety, depression, body satisfaction, and parental behavior.\n\nMaterial and methods: The study involved 240 respondents between 15 and 18 years of age, first year and third year students in two secondary schools in Skopje. During the study, we used the following measurement instruments: Eating Attitude Test, Perception of Parents Scale, Body Shape Questionnaire, Kutcher Adolescent Depressive Scale, The State \u2013 Trait Anxiety Inventory and Body Mass Index.\n\nResults: The obtained results show the existence of interconnection between anxiety, depression, body satisfaction and family factors in relation to eating disorders and body mass index. Simultaneously, we determined that there was a difference in terms of involvement, autonomy support and parental warmth between the low-risk group and the critical group of respondents on the EAT \u2013 26 scale. Anxiety, depression, maternal warmth and autonomy support from both parents were found to be predictors of the occurrence of eating disorders.\n\nConclusion: The implementation of adequate preventive programs will enable the young person to develop a healthy attitude towards nutrition, changes in personal appearance, body, and health.\n"

      "abstract": "Available studies suggest that childhood food experiences (CFE) may be linked with eating behaviors in adulthood, as well as eating style (ES); thus, both CFE and ES can determine dietary intake. Little is known about the role of both of these factors in explaining the diet quality (DQ) of adults. The aim was to investigate to what extent selected ESs, i.e., intuitive (IE), restrained (ResEat), and external (ExtEat) eating, and CFE related to parental feeding practices (PFPs) will predict the DQ of women and men. Data from 708 Polish adults (477 women and 231 men) aged 18\u201365 were collected via the Internet from October 2022 to January 2023. Mann\u2013Whitney\u2019s U Test was used to compare ES and CFE levels among women and men, while DQ determinants were tested with the multiple linear regression (MLR). In the total study sample, \u201cHealthy Eating Guidance\u201d (CFE), \u201cChild Control\u201d (CFE), \u201cBody\u2013Food Choice Congruence\u201d (IE), and ResEat favored higher DQ scores, while \u201cUnconditional Permission to Eat\u201d (IE), \u201cEating for Physical Rather Than Emotional Reasons\u201d (IE), and ExtEat predisposed to lower DQ scores. After the MLR was conducted separately in women and men, differences were noted in the role of \u201cHealthy Eating Guidance\u201d (CFE), \u201cPressure and Food Reward\u201d (CFE), \u201cUnconditional Permission to Eat\u201d (IE), \u201cEating for Physical Rather Than Emotional Reasons\u201d (IE), ExtEat, and ResEat in predicting DQ indices. Our findings suggest that childhood food experiences and selected eating styles may differently determine the DQ of women and men. Future studies conducted within representative samples are needed to confirm these results."

      "abstract": "Adverse interpersonal experiences in childhood have been shown to be associated with low psychological well-being and poor mental health in adulthood. In this study, the Parental Caregiving Style Questionnaire (PCS-Q) was used for the retrospective classification of parental caregiving, a measure distinguishing between warm/responsive, ambivalent/inconsistent and cold/rejecting parenting, analogous to the three-category model of attachment. Furthermore, self-esteem, satisfaction with the romantic relationship and life, depression and anxiety were measured with self-report scales. 197 students took part in this study, of whom 74 answered the PCS-Q a second time two months later. Most participants classified the parental caregiving style as warm/responsive, especially with regard to the mother. The PCS-Q showed a high test-retest reliability. Warm/responsive parenting was associated with higher self-esteem and life satisfaction and with lower depression and anxiety than the other two parenting styles. Satisfaction with the romantic relationship, however, did not differ substantially between the three groups. The findings largely support the assumption that early attachment experiences have an impact on later well-being and mental health. The German version of the PCS-Q presented here can be used in research and clinical practice as an economic measure with direct reference to the model of attachment styles."
