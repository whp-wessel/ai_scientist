      "abstract": "\n Introduction:\n Adversity during childhood, usually measured as retrospectively, is associated with long-term health. We examined associations of\n prospectively\n assessed childhood adversity with young-adult (YA) cardiovascular health (CVH).\n \n \n Methods:\n We included 1155 YAs with adversity measures from baseline Y0 (birth), Y1, Y3, Y5, Y9, and who completed a CVH exam at Y22 in the FFCWS. An adversity score (AS) (range: 0-7) represented the number of adverse childhood exposures experienced by age 9 out of 7 categories - emotional abuse and neglect; physical abuse and neglect; parental incarceration, parental substance use, and interpersonal violence. CVH was estimated using the Life\u2019s Essential 8 (LE8) score (range: 0-100 points) overall and for each component, excluding sleep due to data unavailability. Linear regression models were adjusted for age and sex.\n \n \n Results:\n By age 9, 38% of YAs had experiences from 0-2 categories, 30% experienced 3, 21% experienced 4, and 11% experienced 5-7. People with higher AS were more likely to self-identify as Black compared to White, Hispanic, or other. In addition, higher AS correlated with lower BMI and higher nicotine use. Compared to individuals with 0-2 AS, an AS of 4 was associated with a 3.6-point (CI: -6.5 to -0.7) lower (less favorable) LE8 score and an AS of 5-7 was associated with a 4.9-point (CI: -8.5 to -1.3) lower LE8 score. Among individual LE8 components, smoking and physical activity scores varied significantly by AS. Compared with an AS of 0-2, a score of 5-7 was associated with a 13.0-point (CI: -22.9 to -3.1) lower smoking score. For physical activity an AS of 4 and 5-7 were associated with a 12.1-point (CI: -21.8 to -2.3) and a 14.4-point (CI: -26.3 to -2.4) lower PA score, respectively.\n \n \n Conclusions:\n Higher level of childhood adversity was prospectively associated with lower LE8 scores and worse CVH in young adulthood. Understanding the prospective associations between childhood adversity and CVH can help identify higher risk populations and guide treatment recommendations.\n \n \n \n"

      "abstract": "Using four cross-sectional data files for the United States and Europe we show that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have a substantial and significant apparent impact on subjective wellbeing in adulthood. These ACEs \u2013 which include death of a parent, parental separation or divorce, household financial difficulties, the prolonged absence of a parent, quarreling between parents, parental unemployment, sexual assault, experiencing long-term health problems, being bullied at school, and being beaten or punched as a child \u2013 are associated with significantly lower subjective wellbeing in adulthood. This association is apparent across fifty different subjective wellbeing measures. These include sixteen positive affect measures such as happiness, life satisfaction and domain-specific life satisfaction, and twenty-three negative affect measures such as the GHQ6, loneliness, and feeling down, depressed and tired. In addition, we find ACEs affect perceptions of the area one lives in as an adult including perceptions of drugs, violence and vandalism."

      "abstract": "This study examined the impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on problematic internet use (PIU) in adults, focusing on the mediating roles of Dark Triad traits and emotional dysregulation. A cross-sectional design was employed with 400 adult participants from universities and organizations in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Participants completed self-report measures assessing ACEs, PIU, Dark Triad traits, and emotional dysregulation. Results showed that ACEs were significantly associated with both emotional dysregulation and PIU. Emotional dysregulation was a strong predictor of PIU, while Dark Triad traits had a weaker direct effect. Mediation analyses indicated that both emotional dysregulation and Dark Triad traits partially mediated the relationship between ACEs and PIU. Gender differences were also observed. These findings support the I-PACE model and suggest that interventions aimed at improving emotional regulation could help reduce PIU among individuals with a history of ACEs."
