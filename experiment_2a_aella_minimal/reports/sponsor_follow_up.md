## Email Draft
Subject: Follow-up on Survey Design Deliverables for Childhood Balanced Study

Hello [Sponsor Team],

Thank you for your partnership on the Childhood Balanced Study. Following our earlier brief, we still need the survey design metadata below to finalize weighting and variance estimation protocols. Could you please share the outstanding items or an estimated delivery date?

Outstanding deliverables:
- Calibrated individual weight file or integrated weight column metadata.
- Stratum definitions and primary sampling unit (PSU) identifiers.
- Replicate weight specification (e.g., BRR, JK1/JK2) with scaling factors.
- Weighting and variance estimation methodology documentation.
- Any finite population correction values or universe totals used in calibration.

Once we receive these files we can update the survey design metadata, rerun the validation scripts, and confirm that the weighting specifications align with your production workflow. Please let us know if any of the items have changed or if additional context is required.

Best regards,

[Research Automation Team]
